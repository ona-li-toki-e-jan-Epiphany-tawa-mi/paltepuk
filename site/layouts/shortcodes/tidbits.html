  To try can be cringe<br>
  but what is truly cringe is<br>
  to not try at all.

<h2>That Barn</h2>
<p>
  We had gone on a trip, to see the horses.<br>
  The man showed us this one, named it a fine mare.<br>
  Was brown... or maybe white with spots?<br>
  To tell the truth, I wasn't seeing no horse.<br>
  I was looking. My body was there, at that barn.<br>
  <br>
  But my soul - my soul was far, far away, in a world like no other.<br>
  Dark - so, so dark. The shadows reached out as if to take me hostage.<br>
  Out sprawled endless sidewalks, lit by the yellow of aged street lights.<br>
  I walked - I walked, and I walked. The buzzing filled my mind.<br>
  Felt as cold as the concrete roads. Thoughts like static.<br>
  <br>
  And then, I was home. My brother, lanky like a statue, was watching the TV.<br>
  "How was them horses?," he asked, but he wasn't talking to no one.<br>
  "Wasn't nothing too special," as I fled to my room. He murmed something I didn't catch.<br>
  And to my bed I went, to wake up from this dream.

<p>
  I want to fall<br>
  infinitely far<br>
  onto a bed of stars.
