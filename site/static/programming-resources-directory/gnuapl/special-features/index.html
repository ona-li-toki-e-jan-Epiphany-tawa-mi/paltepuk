id=Installing-APL><h3 class=section>1.1 Installing APL</h3><p>APL is built and installed like this:<ul><li>download the tar file containing GNU APL, from
<a href=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/apl>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/apl</a> or from one of its mirrors
(see <a href=http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html>http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html</a>), and
un-tar the file.<li>read (and follow) the instructions given in file README in the
unpacked directory</ul><p>For the experienced, but impatient reader: it is the usual sequence<ul><li>./configure<li>make<li>make install</ul><p>On success, an executable file named ’apl’ will have been produced
in the sub-directory ’src’.<p>File README contains further instructions about the installation GNU APL.</div><div class=section id=Starting-APL><h3 class=section>1.2 Starting APL</h3><p>Last things first: before explaining how to start APL, it is important to
remember how to stop (i.e. exit) it. Neither ^C nor ^D will stop APL
- they serve other purposes. Instead, you leave APL with the command
)OFF (on a separate line) like this:<p>)OFF<p>If APL is computing a function (and possibly caught in an endless loop),
then you may have to press <b>^C</b> (this is called <i>ATTENTION</i> in APL) to
return to APL’s command mode so that the <b>)OFF</b> command can be entered.
In some circumstances it may be necessary to press <b>^C</b> twice within a
short time interval (this is called <i>INTERRUPT</i> in APL).<p>Having that said, APL is started like every other program - by entering its
name and optional command line parameters, for example:<p>$ apl<p>or:<p>$ apl <b><tt>-id</tt></b> 1001<p>GNU APL is script-able; a text file whose first line looks like this (assuming
the APL interpreter binary is called ’apl’ and is located in the current
directory):<p>#! ./apl<p>or (if the APL interpreter binary is not in the current directory but in
/mypath/apl):<p>#! /mypath/apl<p>The path to the ’apl’ binary can be missing (like in the first example),
relative, or absolute (second example). The exact details of how the first
line of a GNU APL script shall look vary slightly among operating systems.
Please consult the info (or man) pages for ’path_resolution’ and/or ’execve’
on your operating system. After the name of the binary, optional GNU APL
command line options, usually –script, can be provided.<p>The text file must, of course, have execute permission, and should be ASCII
or, more likely, UTF-8 encoded. The APL characters in the script shall be
those defined in the Unicode character set (most of them in the U+2200 -
U+23FF range).</div><div class=section id=Command-Line-Options><h3 class=section>1.3 Command Line Options</h3><p>GNU APL understands the following command line options:<ul><li><b><tt>-C new_root</tt></b><p>perform chroot("new_root") followed by chdir("/"). This restricts the access
of the process running GNU APL to files in or below directory new_root, and
it also changes the current directory (which could have resided above
new_root before the chroot() was executed).<p>The -C option is intended to be a security feature for GNU APL interpreters
that are facing a hostile environment like the public internet.<p>NOTES:<ul><li>For -C to work, new_root needs to contain a minimal set of binaries, in
particular a shell, and possibly libraries needed by the shell. Consult
’info chroot invocation’ for issues to consider and common pitfalls.<li>GNU APL processes the -C option (i.e. it calls chroot("new_root")) before
all other command line options. As a consequence, file names in other command
line options of GNU APL are also affected by -C. That means that the file
names in command line options are being interpreted relative to new_root
and <b>not</b> relative to the current directory of the process that had
started GNU APL.<li>GNU APL may automatically start other processes such as APserver and friends
after processing the -C option. These processes (and the libraries that they
depend on) should reside in the proper directory below new_root. For example,
with the default configuration of GNU APL, GNU APL installs itself in
/usr/local/bin and also expects APserver in the same directory. After -C
new_root, however, /usr/local/bin is no longer accessible and one would need
to copy /usr/local/bin/APserver to new_root/usr/local/bin/APserver<li>Depending on your platform, the process using -C may need root privileges.</ul><li><b><tt>--cfg</tt></b><p>show ./configure options that were used to configure GNU APL, and exit.<li><b><tt>--[no]Color</tt></b><p>start with ]COLOR ON [OFF].<li><b><tt>-d</tt></b><p>run the APL interpreter (or APL script) in the background (i.e. as a daemon).
For this to work you need to provide some input to the background process,
e.g. via the -f option.<li><b><tt>--emacs</tt></b><p>run in (old) Emacs mode.<li><b><tt>--emacs_arg arg</tt></b><p>run in (new) Emacs mode with argument arg.<li><b><tt>--eval line</tt></b><p>evaluate one APL line and exit. This option can be given several times; in
that case several lines are being executed before GNU apl exits. Keep in
mind that command line options are normally processed by your shell before
being passed to apl. Therefore sometimes quoting the argument of –eval may
be needed and common wisdom has it to always quote the argument of –eval.<li><b><tt>-f file</tt></b><p>read input from <i>file</i> rather than from the keyboard. When the end of
the file is reached, input is switched back to the keyboard.
If you want to terminate the APL interpreter after executing the file,
then use )OFF as last line in the file.<li><b><tt>--gpl</tt></b><p>show GNU APL license (GPL) and exit.<li><b><tt>-L wsname</tt></b><p>)LOAD wsname on start-up.<li><b><tt>--LX expr</tt></b><p>execute <b>expr</b> first. The workspace behaves as if ⎕LX (latent
expression) were set to <b>expr</b> in the workspace. This can be used,
for example, to start the same workspace with different start-up values.<li><b><tt>-h</tt></b>, <b><tt>--help</tt></b><p>print all command line options with a brief hint about what they do.<li><b><tt>--id proc</tt></b><p>use processor ID proc for this interpreter. If no ID is provided, then the
first unused ID > 1000 is taken by this interpreter and the ID becomes used
as long as the interpreter runs. Processor IDs are used by shared variables
to identify share partners.<li><b><tt>-l num</tt></b><p>turn logging facility <b>num</b> ON (provided that dynamic logging was
./configure’d). The logging facility 37 (start-up messages) is of particular
importance for troubleshooting and it works even if dynamic logging
was not ./configure’d.<li><b><tt>--mem [memory-limit]</tt></b><p>tell the interpreter not to use more than memory-limit bytes of RAM. By
using this option, the user is fully responsible for ensuring that the
specified amount of memory will always be available. The following rules
should be observed.<p>The interpreter will exit at start-up if <b><tt>--mem</tt></b> is used and:<ul><li>the platform on which the interpreter runs has no /proc/meminfo, or<li>the platform has no /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory, or<li>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is not 2 (aka. ’never overcommit’)</ul><p>On GNU/Linux systems these conditions are normally satisfied, but the root
user has to set /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory to 2 which differs from the
default value 0 (aka. overcommit allowed).<p>If no memory-limit is given, then a memory-limit of 50% is used.<p>If a memory-limit is provided then it must have a unit of %, kB, MB, or GB.
If the unit is % then the limit is computed as that percentage (between 5%
and 95%) of parameter ’MemFree:’ in /proc/meminfo. Otherwise the limit
is the given amount in kB, MB, or GB.<p>For example:<ul><li><b><tt>--mem</tt></b> (50% of MemFree: in /proc/meminfo are guaranteed)<li><b><tt>--mem 80%</tt></b> (80% of MemFree: in /proc/meminfo are guaranteed)<li><b><tt>--mem 5G</tt></b> (5 GB are guaranteed)</ul><p>WARNING: The memory-limit is checked against parameter ’MemFree’ in
/proc/meminfo when GNU APL starts, but this does not protect against
other processes consuming the free memory at a later point in time.<p>If that happens (and according to the rules above the user has the
responsibility to prevent it), then ⎕WA becomes unreliable and the
interpreter may crash badly (i.e. without a WS FULL error, and without
any chance to )SAVE the workspace) when the available memory is exhausted.<li><b><tt>--echoCIN</tt></b>
copy the input line (after editing) to stdout. For creating session logs.<li><b><tt>--noCIN</tt></b><p>do not echo stdin to stdout. Almost a must for scripting (unless you
intend to troubleshoot a script).<li><b><tt>--to_COUT</tt></b><p>normally GNU APL writes its output to stderr (i.e. file descriptor 2) so that,
when GNU APL is started in a script, the output of the script appears on
stdout (i.e. file descriptor 1) while the output of GNU APL appears on stderr.<p>This option redirects the stderr output of GNU APL to stdout. The same effect
can be achieved with the option "OUTPUT-TO-COUT Yes" in a preferences file.<li><b><tt>--tcp_port PORT</tt></b><p>this option starts GNU APL as a server that listens on TCP port PORT.
Every TCP connection accepted by the server forks a new GNU APL instance
which has its stdin, stdout, and stderr redirected to the TCP connection.<p>WARNING: This option is dangerous if PORT is directly exposed to the internet!<li><b><tt>--noCONT</tt></b><p>do not load a SETUP or CONTINUE workspace on start-up.<li><b><tt>--OFF</tt></b><p>This option causes GNU APL to perform an automatic )OFF command after the
last line of the last input file (as per -f option) was executed.<li><b><tt>--PW COLS</tt></b><p>set the initial value of ⎕PW to COLS (min. 30, max. 10000)<li><b><tt>--[no]SV</tt></b><p>do [not] start APserver (a shared variable server) on start-up. This disables
communication with other workspaces or auxiliary processors through
shared variables.<li><b><tt>-p N</tt></b><p>use profile number N in preferences files. A preference file may contain
several sets of settings for different purposes; the profile number selects
one of these sets.<li><b><tt>--par pproc</tt></b><p>use processor parent ID pproc (default: no parent ID).<li><b><tt>--rawCIN</tt></b><p>do not emit ESC sequences. Normally ESC sequences are emitted for colored
output and during line editing. In scripts, however, ESC sequences usually
are not wanted and can be turned off with this option.<li><b><tt>-s</tt></b>, <b><tt>--script</tt></b><p>this option is an abbreviation for:
<b><tt>--silent</tt></b> <b><tt>--noCIN</tt></b> <b><tt>--noCONT</tt></b> <b><tt>-f -</tt></b>
which is a typical combination of options for APL scripts.<li><b><tt>-q</tt></b>, <b><tt>--silent</tt></b><p>suppress printing of the GNU APL welcome message. Useful for scripts.<li><b><tt>--safe</tt></b><p>disable shared variables and native functions<li><b><tt>--show_bin_dir</tt></b><p>display the binary directory (where, according to ./configure, the programs
apl, APserver, AP100, and AP210 are supposed to be installed. Then exit.<li><b><tt>--show_doc_dir</tt></b><p>display the directory where, according to ./configure, documentation files
for GNU APL are installed. Then exit.<li><b><tt>--show_etc_dir</tt></b><p>display the system configuration directory where, according to ./configure,
the preferences file for GNU APL is installed. Then exit.<li><b><tt>--show_lib_dir</tt></b><p>display the library directory where, according to ./configure, shared library
files and the workspaces shipped with GNU APL are installed. Then exit.<li><b><tt>--show_src_dir</tt></b><p>display the source directory where, according to ./configure, GNU APL
was compiled. Then exit. This can be used, for example, by native functions
that are built outside the GNU APL source tree to find GNU APL header files
that are needed to compile the native function.<li><b><tt>--show_all_dirs</tt></b><p>display all the directories above. Then exit.<li><b><tt>-T testcases ...</tt></b>
run testcases. Testcases are text files that contain both input to the APL
interpreter and the expected response from the interpreter. The output from
the interpreter is compared with the expected output in the testcase file(s)
and differences are marked. In addition a summary file is created that tells
whether or not each of the testcases was successful.<li><b><tt>--TM mode</tt></b><p>test mode. This option specifies how the interpreter shall behave
when running a number of testcases (as specified with the <b><tt>-T</tt></b> option)<p><b><tt>--TM 0</tt></b> (default) run all testcases and exit after the last testcase.<p><b><tt>--TM 1</tt></b> like <b><tt>--TM 0</tt></b> if no error was detected.
However, if one of the testcases has failed, then the interpreter
does not exit so that the user can investigate the state of APL
(SI, variable values, etc.).<p><b><tt>--TM 2</tt></b> like <b><tt>--TM 1</tt></b>, but stay in the interpreter even if
all testcases have passed. This can be useful for quickly bringing the
interpreter into a specific state and continue manual troubleshooting
from that state.<p><b><tt>--TM 3</tt></b> like <b><tt>--TM 1</tt></b>, but stop testcase execution after the
first failed testcase (i.e. do not exit).<p><b><tt>--TM 4</tt></b> like <b><tt>--TM 3</tt></b>, but exit after the first failed
testcase. This is useful for automatic regression tests, where no errors
are expected.<li><b><tt>--TR</tt></b><p>executes test case files in random order.<li><b><tt>--TS</tt></b><p>Normally, when the interpreter is run with the <b><tt>-T</tt></b> option,
an existing summary.log file is overwritten without notice.
This option causes new test results to be appended to a possibly
existing summary.log instead of overwriting it.<li><b><tt>-v</tt></b>, <b><tt>--version</tt></b>,<p>show version information and exit.<li><b><tt>-u UID</tt></b><p>run as user with UID 0. This option can only be used by the root user (who
then wants to run as a different user).<li><b><tt>-w milli</tt></b><p>wait milli milliseconds at start-up. Useful to give other programs that are
started together with this interpreter time to initialize themselves.<li><b><tt>+APPOPT</tt></b><li><b><tt>++APPOPT ARG1</tt></b><li><b><tt>+++APPOPT ARG1 ARG2</tt></b><li>...<p>Those command line options above that start with - are understood by the
GNU APL binary and their arguments must follow the description given for
them. In addition the interpreter also accepts command line options that
start with +. However, these options are not checked by the interpreter
in any way, but are merely copied to ⎕ARG (see below). In these options,
APPOPT, ARG1, ARG2, ... are arbitrary strings that should not contain any
whitespace characters. The purpose of these options is to control aspects
of the APL application from the command line.<li><b><tt>--</tt></b><p>end of command line options for the interpreter. GNU APL provides the system
variable ⎕ARG that returns all command line options with which the GNU APL
interpreter was invoked (similar to variable argv in main(int argc,

previous section can be set in a configuration file for GNU APL. The name
of the configuration file is ’preferences’ and it should live in one of
the following directories:<ul><li>in the sub-directory gnu-apl.d of the system configuration directory, or<li>in the sub-directory .config/gnu-apl of the user’s home directory (as per
$HOME).</ul><p>The system configuration directory is usually /etc or /usr/local/etc and is
configurable via <samp>./configure --sysconfdir</samp>. An empty (i.e. most
settings commented out) preferences file is also installed in the
system configuration directory when GNU APL is installed. You can edit
it, use it as a template or read it to see which options can be controlled.<p>If file ’preferences’ exists in both directories, the settings in
$HOME/.config/gnu-apl/preferences override settings in, for example,
/etc/gnu-apl.d/preferences.<p>Command line options in turn override settings in ’preferences’ files.</div><div class=section id=File-Names-and-Paths><h3 class=section>1.5 File Names and Paths</h3><p>The GNU APL interpreter is a binary file named ’apl’. It is usually
installed in directory /usr/bin/ or in /usr/local/bin/. The location
where ’apl’ is installed can be changed via ./configure options
(see file INSTALL).<p>GNU APL understands 4 file types:<ol><li>APL workspaces that can be manipulated with the )LOAD, )SAVE,
)COPY, and )DROP commands. APL workspaces are XML files and must have a
file extension of .xml to be accepted by GNU APL. APL workspaces can only
be exchanged between machines that all run GNU APL.<li>APL exchange files can be manipulated with the )IN and )OUT
commands. APL exchange files are text files in ⎕TF format defined by IBM
(basically APL expressions that create variables or functions)
and must have a file extension of .atf to be accepted by GNU APL.
APL exchange files can be exchanged between machines running APL
interpreters from different vendors. The ⎕TF format can be easily emulated
on machines not providing compatible )IN and )OUT commands.<li>APL scripts consist of APL commands and APL expressions (including
function definition via ∇) like they would be entered by the user.
APL scripts should have a file extension of .apl but other extensions
are also accepted by GNU APL. APL scripts are, for example, the files
expected for the -f command line option. A workspace can be written in this
format with the )DUMP command.<li>APL testcase files are similar to APL scripts, but in addition to
the APL commands and expressions they also contain the expected output
from the commands.
APL testcase files normally have a file extension of .tc for normal
(functional) testcases and .pt for performance testcases.
APL testcase files are, for example, the files expected for the
-T command line option.</ol><p>The following APL commands are related to file names:<p>)LOAD [lib] name[.xml]<p>)SAVE [lib] [name[.xml]]<p>)COPY [lib] [name[.xml]]<p>)PCOPY [lib] [name[.xml]]<p>)DROP [lib] [name[.xml]]<p>)IN [lib] name[.atf]<p>)PIN [lib] name[.atf]<p>)OUT [lib] name[.atf]<p>)DUMP [lib] [name[.apl]]<p>)LIB [lib]<p>)LIBS [new-lib-root]<p>)WSID [name]<p>The rules for how file names are constructed from the argument(s) of an APL
command are:<ol><li>command arguments shown in brackets are optional.<li>lib is a number from 0 to 9. If lib is not present then 0 is taken
as default.<li>if the name is optional and missing then the workspace ID (the name
set with the )WSID command) is used.<li>if the file extension (i.e. .xml or .atf) is missing then it is
appended automatically to name.</ol><p>If the name starts with ’/’ then it is taken as an absolute path to
the file (an absolute file name) and no further computation is done
with the name.<p>Otherwise name is a relative path which is relative to some directory
library-root and a sub-directory of library-root that is determined by
the lib number. The library numbers 0-9 correspond to the following
directories:<p>0: library-root/workspaces/<p>1: library-root/wslib1/<p>2: library-root/wslib2/<p>...<p>9: library-root/wslib9/<p>The command )LIBS without arguments shows the mapping between library
numbers and paths. The command )LIBS with an argument sets a new lib-root.<p>The command )LIB [lib] shows the files in library (i.e. directory) lib.<p>The directory library-root is computed as follows when the interpreter starts:<p>If an environment variable APL_LIB_ROOT is defined, then its value is used
as library-root. Otherwise the path from the current directory (".") up to
the root directory ("/") is searched until a directory containing two
files ’workspaces’ and ’wslib1’ is found. Normally ’workspaces’ and ’wslib1’
are directories, but for the computation of library-root files suffice.<p>If such a directory is found, then it is used as library-root; otherwise the
current directory (i.e. ".") is used and converted to an absolute path.<p>For example, if library-root is "." then the command<p>)LOAD 2 test<p>will try to load the workspace file<p>./wslib2/test.xml<p>Using a library root implies that all 10 library directories are contained
in the same directory. This is good enough for single-user environments but
is often not adequate for multi-user environments where some directories
are not writable by users and different users have different home directories.<p>For that reason the above library root scheme can be overridden by the
GNU APL configuration files (preferences). In these files you can un-comment
any of the LIBREF-0 to LIBREF-9 settings (which correspond to library
numbers 0 to 9) and provide your own paths. The library numbers NOT overridden
in a ’preferences’ file still follow the library root scheme.<hr></div></div><div class=chapter id=Chapter-2><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Chapter-3 accesskey=n rel=next>Limitations and Missing Features</a>, Previous: <a href=#Chapter-1 accesskey=p rel=prev>Installing and Starting GNU APL</a>, Up: <a href=#Top accesskey=u rel=up>GNU APL</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Non_002dstandard-GNU-APL-Features></span><h2 class=chapter>2 Non-standard GNU APL Features</h2><p>There are a few hopefully useful features in GNU APL:<ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#Section-2_002e1 accesskey=1>APL Scripting</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e2 accesskey=2>Axis argument in defined functions</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e3 accesskey=3>Colored Output</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e4 accesskey=4>Comparison Rules</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e5 accesskey=5>Complex Numbers</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e6 accesskey=6>Debug Commands</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e7 accesskey=7>Direct Functions (Lambdas)</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e8 accesskey=8>]DOXY Command</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e9 accesskey=9>Commands )COPY_ONCE, )DUMP, and DUMP-HTML</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e10>]NEXTFILE and ]PUSHFILE Commands</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e11>History and TAB completion</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e12>Logging Facilities</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e13>Rational Numbers</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e14>Hex Numbers</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e15>User-defined Commands</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e16>Structured Variables and Associative Arrays</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e17>Monadic ⊢ and ⊣, dyadic ⊢ with Axis</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e18>Bit-wise Logical Functions ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ⊤⍲, ⊤⍱, ⊤≠, and ⊤=</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e19>Generalized ⍳</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e20>⌹[X] - QR Factorization</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e21>Dyadic ⎕CR</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e22>Dyadic ⎕FX (Native Functions)</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e23>⎕ARG - Interpreter command line arguments</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e24>⎕DLX - Knuth’s Dancing Links Algorithm</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e25>⎕ENV - Environment Variables</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e26>⎕FIO - File I/O Functions</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e27>⎕FFT - Fast Fourier Transform</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e28>⎕GTK - GTK Interface</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e29>⎕JSON - JSON Parsing</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e30>⎕MAP - Map Value</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e31>⎕PLOT - Plot Data</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e32>⎕PNG - Portable Network Graphics</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e33>⎕PS - Print Style</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e34>⎕RE - Regular Expressions</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e35>⎕RVAL - Random APL value</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e36>⎕SQL - SQL Database Interface</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e37>⎕SI - State Indicator</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e38>⎕SYL - System limits</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e39>⎕XML - XML Parsing</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e40>Conditionals</a><li><a href=#Section-2_002e41>Matrix Product</a></ul><hr><div class=section id=Section-2_002e1><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Section-2_002e2 accesskey=n rel=next>Axis argument in defined functions</a>, Up: <a href=#Chapter-2 accesskey=u rel=up>Non-standard GNU APL Features</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=APL-Scripting></span><h3 class=section>2.1 APL Scripting</h3><p>As already mentioned, it is possible to write APL scripts.

of the GNU APL binary on the command line of a shell, or indirectly by
entering the name of a script that provides the name of the GNU APL binary
on the first line of the script. In the latter case, the shell uses function
execve() to start APL, and one can provide additional arguments that are
passed on to APL. We briefly discuss both cases:<p>0. General Remark<p>There is a convention in (not only) GNU APL, that the command line options
(and possibly an optional option argument) that occur left of <b><tt>--</tt></b> are
options directed to (and understood by) the APL interpreter while the options
right of <b><tt>--</tt></b> are passed to the APL application (and their exact format is
then defined by the APL application). All command line options that were used
to start APL can later be retrieved with the system variable ⎕ARG in APL.<p>Example 1: APL started directly<p>We start APL with some command line options and display them with ⎕ARG.
The command line options for the interpreter are –silent, -l, and 37,
while the options app1 and app2 are for the APL application:<pre class=verbatim>$ apl --silent -l 37 -- app1 app2
    ⊃⎕ARG
apl
--silent
-l
37
--
app1
app2
</pre><p>Example 2: APL started indirectly<p>A script is a text file which has execute permissions. The first line
of a script, commonly known as the <b>shebang</b> of the script, has a
special format which specifies how the subsequent lines of the script file
shall be processed, see <b>man execve</b> for details.<p>A GNU APL script is then a script whose shebang indicates the apl binary as
the interpreter for the subsequent lines where those subsequent lines are
either APL commands or APL statements. With some limitations, executing such
an APL script yields the same result as entering the subsequent lines in
immediate execution mode.<p>When APL is started directly, there is only one (possibly empty) set of
command line options, which are processed by the shell and then passed
to the apl binary.<p>Starting APL indirectly refers to executing an APL script. In this case
there are two sets of command line options:<ul><li>those passed to the script as command line arguments, and<li>those on the shebang line of the script</ul><p>When the APL script is started, possibly with command line arguments, the
command line arguments entered by the user are combined with the arguments
on the shebang line of the script in a way that is described in ’man 2 execve’.<p>Assume the script file SCRIPT.apl contains this (the file is shipped
with GNU APL):<pre class=verbatim>#! /usr/local/bin/apl --id 1010 --script

      ⊃⎕ARG     ⍝ show command line options
      )OFF      ⍝ leave the interpreter

</pre><p>Assume further that the script is started like this:<pre class=verbatim>$ ./SCRIPT.apl sarg1 sarg2
</pre><p>Then the following output, which shows the order of command line options
as seen by ⎕ARG, is produced:<pre class=verbatim>   ⊃⎕ARG
/usr/local/bin/apl
--script
./SCRIPT.apl
sarg1
sarg2
</pre><p>This suggests that the options and option arguments are constructed by execve()
(the function that is eventually responsible for processing scripts in shells
and other executables) in the following order:<p>1. Interpreter name (the first name in the shebang, here: /usr/local/bin/apl)<p>2. Optional Interpreter arguments (here: –script)<p>3. Script filename (here: ./SCRIPT.apl)<p>4. Script arguments (here: sarg1 sarg2)<p>CAUTION: as discussed in ’man 2 execve’ the interpretation of the optional
interpreter arguments (2. above) is system specific and possibly not portable.
For that reason the optional interpreter argument should not be missing (you
can use – to provide at least one argument) and also not more than one
argument. On GNU/Linux systems the following shebang lines of the script are
understood:<pre class=verbatim>/usr/local/bin/apl
/usr/local/bin/apl --
/usr/local/bin/apl -s
/usr/local/bin/apl --script
/usr/local/bin/apl -s --
/usr/local/bin/apl --script --
</pre><p>The recommended form is: <tt>/usr/local/bin/apl --script</tt>.<p>Note that <b><tt>--</tt></b> and any options that follow it on the shebang line
MAY OR MAY NOT be included in ⎕ARG (this depends on the platform used).
In contrast, options that follow <b><tt>--</tt></b> on the script command line
WILL BE shown since this is controlled by GNU APL and not by the platform.
There is normally no point in passing any application options on the shebang
line to APL because such parameters can more easily be provided directly
further down in the script. However, in cases where the script has only
application options it may be convenient to make <b><tt>--</tt></b> the last
option of the shebang so that the user of the script need not specify it
manually.<p>Using <b><tt>--</tt></b> on the shebang line of the script file usually prevents
subsequent options on the shebang line from being interpreted as APL options
(and, more importantly, from causing <b>unknown option</b> errors when GNU APL
starts). At least under GNU/Linux with <b>bash</b> the subsequent options will
be passed to the APL application via ⎕ARG.<p>Depending on this exact behavior cannot be recommended. A cleaner approach
is to use options starting with - or <b><tt>--</tt></b> only for the interpreter
options, and options starting with + for application options. This should
work on all platforms because for strings, say, APLOPT, ARG1, ARG2, ...,
which contain no whitespace:<ul><li><b>+APLOPT</b> is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,<li><b>++APLOPT ARG1</b> is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,<li><b>+++APLOPT ARG1 ARG2</b> is ignored, although shown in ⎕ARG,<li><b>...</b></ul><hr></div><div class=subsection id=Subsection-2_002e1_002e4><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e5 accesskey=n rel=next>Double-quoted Strings</a>, Previous: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e3 accesskey=p rel=prev>How command line arguments are handled</a>, Up: <a href=#Section-2_002e1 accesskey=u rel=up>APL Scripting</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Helpful-Features-for-Scripting></span><h4 class=subsection>2.1.4 Helpful Features for Scripting</h4><p>GNU APL provides three system variables and functions that are particularly
useful for scripting:<ul><li>⎕ARG: access to the command line arguments given to the interpreter,<li>⎕ENV: access to the environment variables of the process running the
interpreter, and<li>⎕INP: Here-Document-alike function for creating large text variables</ul><ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#g_t_005b_003f_005dARG accesskey=1>⎕ARG</a><li><a href=#g_t_005b_003f_005dENV accesskey=2>⎕ENV</a><li><a href=#g_t_005b_003f_005dINP accesskey=3>⎕INP</a></ul><div class=subsubsection id=g_t_005b_003f_005dARG><h4 class=subsubsection>2.1.4.1 ⎕ARG</h4><p>The system variable ⎕ARG contains all command line arguments passed to the
interpreter. In the initial example above this would be a nested 3-element
vector:<pre class=verbatim>    /usr/local/bin/apl --id 1010
</pre></div><div class=subsubsection id=g_t_005b_003f_005dENV><h4 class=subsubsection>2.1.4.2 ⎕ENV</h4><p>There are usually at least two ways of passing parameters to a script:<ul><li>as command line options, and/or<li>by means of environment variables</ul><p>Just as the system variable ⎕ARG makes the command line options used
available to APL, so does the system function ⎕ENV make the environment
variables available to APL. Since there normally exist far more
environment variables than command line options, ⎕ENV is a monadic function
whose argument is a filter for the name(s) of the variable(s) to be retrieved.<p>⎕ENV B returns all environment variables whose name starts with B.
If ⍴B is 0, like:<pre class=verbatim>    ⎕ENV ''
</pre><p>then <b>all</b> environment variables of the process running GNU APL are
returned.<p>The result of ⎕ENV is a (possibly empty) N×2 matrix. The first column
contains the name(s) of the environment variable(s), while the second
column contains their value(s). The name and the value are both strings.<p>The number N of environment variables returned by ⎕ENV obviously depends on
the number of environment variables whose name begins with the prefix
given in B; shorter prefixes B therefore result in higher counts N. B is case
sensitive; by convention the names of environment variables are all uppercase.
Note the subtle difference between shell variables and environment variables
in shells like <b>bash</b>: ⎕ENV returns only environment variables (which
are set with command <b>setenv</b> in bash), but not shell variables (which
are set with command <b>set</b> in bash). For a shell variable to occur
in ⎕ENV it must be <b>export</b>ed into the environment of the process
before the GNU APL interpreter is started.</div><div class=subsubsection id=g_t_005b_003f_005dINP><h4 class=subsubsection>2.1.4.3 ⎕INP</h4><p>If you need to create a longer static text, like the body of a web page,
then you would normally construct it in APL like this:<pre class=verbatim>BODY ← ⊂ 'First line'
BODY ← BODY , ⊂ 'Second line'
BODY ← BODY , ⊂ 'Third line'
   ...
</pre><p>The above is obviously not very handy for longer texts. Instead you may
write the following in a GNU APL script:<pre class=verbatim>BODY←⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP'
First line
Second line
Third line
   ...
END-OF-⎕INP
</pre><p>This works like "Here documents" in <b>bash</b>. The right argument of ⎕INP is
the end of text marker.<p>⎕INP also has a dyadic form where the left argument specifies an escape
sequence from text to APL and back to the text, similar to PHP scripts.
For example:<pre class=verbatim>Z←'&lt;?apl' '?&gt;' ⎕INP 'END-OF-⎕INP'
First line
Time is now: &lt;?apl ⍕⎕TS ?&gt;
Third line
...
END-OF-⎕INP
</pre><p>This creates a mainly static text with a small dynamic plug-in computed by
APL:<pre class=verbatim>      ⊃Z
First line
Time is now: 2022 8 4 15 15 2 177
Third line
...
</pre><p>It should be noted that, while ⎕INP simplifies the construction of multi-line
strings compared to standard APL, it has come of age and these days an even
simpler feature - Multi-line strings as described below - is provided for the
same purpose. The monadic ⎕INP has therefore become obsolete.<hr></div></div><div class=subsection id=Subsection-2_002e1_002e5><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e6 accesskey=n rel=next>Multi-Line Strings</a>, Previous: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e4 accesskey=p rel=prev>Helpful Features for Scripting</a>, Up: <a href=#Section-2_002e1 accesskey=u rel=up>APL Scripting</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Double_002dquoted-Strings></span><h4 class=subsection>2.1.5 Double-quoted Strings</h4><p>Standard APL literals (aka. strings) such as ’Hello’ are single quoted. As a
matter of convenience, GNU APL also provides double-quoted strings which
differ from single quoted strings in two ways:<ul><li>A standard single quoted APL string is a vector if its length ≠ 1 but
a scalar if its length = 1. This is sometimes inconvenient and therefore
double-quoted strings are more consistent in always being vectors regardless
of their length. In other words, ’A’ is a scalar while "A" is a vector.<li>Double-quoted strings understand the standard C escape sequences
for control character, such as \n for ASCII line feed, \t for ASCII TAB, etc.</ul><hr></div><div class=subsection id=Subsection-2_002e1_002e6><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e7 accesskey=n rel=next>Automatic )MORE</a>, Previous: <a href=#Subsection-2_002e1_002e5 accesskey=p rel=prev>Double-quoted Strings</a>, Up: <a href=#Section-2_002e1 accesskey=u rel=up>APL Scripting</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Multi_002dLine-Strings></span><h4 class=subsection>2.1.6 Multi-Line Strings</h4><p>A substantial disadvantage of ⎕INP is that it only works in immediate
execution mode (and consequently also in .apl scripts), but not the bodies of
defined functions. Multi-line strings fill this gap for string literals that
span several lines of text <b>inside</b> the body of defined functions.
Multi-Line strings have become more and more advanced (and elegant) over time.
For this reason they currently come in different flavors (of which the older
ones will eventually disappear).<ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#Old_002dstyle-Multi_002dLine-Strings accesskey=1>Old-style Multi-Line Strings</a><li><a href=#New_002dstyle-Multi_002dLine-Strings accesskey=2>New-style Multi-Line Strings</a><li><a href=#g_t_00ab-_00bb-Strings accesskey=3>« » Strings</a></ul><div class=subsubsection id=Old_002dstyle-Multi_002dLine-Strings><h4 class=subsubsection>2.1.6.1 Old-style Multi-Line Strings</h4><p>Old-style multi-line strings were the first attempt to provide long strings
for defined functions. The idea for the old-style multi-line strings was
adopted from shells like <b>bash</b> where, for example,<pre class=verbatim>echo "Line1
   Line2"
</pre><p>prints:<pre class=verbatim>Line1
   Line2
</pre><p>In simple terms this means that as long as the number of " characters is
odd, the string remains open until the closing " is found (which makes
the number even again).<p>Old-style multi-line strings are not allowed in immediate execution mode
because they could easily be entered by mistake (by simply forgetting the
terminating " or ’ of a standard string) and that would have obscured the
familiar behavior of immediate execution mode. In function definition
mode, the total number of function lines is known and it can therefore
check if a multi-line string inside the function is properly terminated.
Immediate execution mode, however, is open-ended and therefore a forgotten
closing " can lead to a fatal misinterpretation of (intended) string
content as (unintended) APL code, with lots of nonsense error messages.<p>Like in <b>bash</b> and also other shells, an old-style multi-line string starts
at the last " on a line of a defined function that has an
<b>an odd number of " characters</b>. The string continues over the subsequent
function lines until the next " is found. The result is a nested
APL value containing one nested string per line involved.<p>In immediate execution mode an old-style multi-line string yields, like
in standard APL:<pre class=verbatim>No string end found+
</pre><p>For example:<pre class=verbatim>∇Z←FOO
 Z←"ABC
 DEF
 GHIJK"

string, but completely empty lines in defined functions are ignored:<pre class=verbatim>∇Z←FOO

strings for defined functions achieved, at least in principle, the goal of
specifying large amounts of text in a simpler manner than in standard APL.
However, having different methods for creating multi-line string literals
in different APL modes could not convince entirely.<p>The search for a more intuitive and more consistent solution then led to
new-style multi-line strings. These strings adopted the triple quote (""")
syntax known from e.g. the Python language. The syntax of new-style
multi-line strings is cleaner: empty lines are handled more consistently and
the string lines are completely separated from the APL code lines.
More importantly, new-style multi-line strings work alike in immediate
execution mode, in scripts, and in defined functions. New-style strings are a
little different and syntactically stricter than their old-style companions:<ul><li>the starting """ must be placed at the end of an APL code line, i.e.
there is no more mixing of APL code and string content on the same line.
An old-style string starts with APL code and ends with the first line of
the string, while a new-style string starts with an APL code line and
the string itself begins at the following line.<li>the ending """ must be placed at the end of a separate line with only
spaces allowed before the """ (to horizontally indent-align it with the
leading """ if so desired). In old-style strings the text up to the
termination " is part of the string while in new-style strings it is not.<li>Neither the starting nor the ending line become nested strings of the
result, and every line can be clearly identified as being either APL code or
else string text.</ul><p>Example:<pre class=verbatim> 4 ⎕CR """

  GHIJK

</pre><p>When entering new-style multi-line strings, the prompt is prefixed by → to
indicate that a Multi-Line String is being entered.<p>⎕INP and old-style strings will coexist for a while, but may eventually
disappear at some point in time.</div><div class=subsubsection id=g_t_00ab-_00bb-Strings><h4 class=subsubsection>2.1.6.3 « » Strings</h4><p>When new-style multi-line strings are used in scripts the related error
reporting (if the syntax is used incorrectly) can become cumbersome. For
example, if one forgets the closing """ of a multi-line string then the next
""" (which was meant as the start of a new multi-line string) is mistaken as
the (forgotten) end of the previous one. The often long content of
the new string is then parsed as APL code and will usually produce many
error messages, all of them nonsense. Things get worse if the script itself
is long because the odd/even nature of the quotes will then persist until
the end of the string (or at least until the next forgotten quote, if any).<p>To deal with this problem, GNU APL also allows strings whose contents are
enclosed in double angle quotation marks « and ». In inline strings ’...’
and "...", as well as in multi-line strings """ ... """, there is no general
(and reliable) way to decide if a user has forgotten the ending quote(s),
which leads to the problems above.<p>For this reason, GNU APL now also allows inline and multi-line strings
like, for example:<pre class=verbatim>      «Hello world»
Hello world

how ⎕ARG looks like. If stdin is redirected then there is only one (possibly
empty) set of command line options. Otherwise there are two sets of command
line options: command line options for the apl interpreter and command line
options for the script.<p>Consider the following simple script called SCRIPT.apl in directory workspaces:<pre class=verbatim>#! /usr/local/bin/apl --script

 /usr/local/bin/apl --silent -f ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl
</pre><p>then the first line <samp>#! /usr/local/bin/apl --script</samp> of file SCRIPT.apl
is merely a comment (GNU APL accepts both the traditional APL character
⍝ and the character # as start of a comment). The <b><tt>--script</tt></b> option
is therefore ignored and the following mix of input and output is
shown on the screen. The input from the script is indented by the
usual APL prompt of 6 blanks, while the output of the APL interpreter
is not indented.<pre class=verbatim>      #! /usr/local/bin/apl --script

      ⊃⎕ARG     ⍝ show command line options
      )OFF      ⍝ leave the interpreter

</pre><p>If we run the same script directly:<pre class=verbatim>../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl
</pre><p>Then we get:<pre class=verbatim> /usr/local/bin/apl --script ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl

</pre><p>The <b><tt>--script</tt></b> implies <b><tt>--noCIN</tt></b> so that the
input lines for the interpreter are no longer echoed to the output.
This is most likely what you want when writing a script.<p>Also, the first line of the script is no longer ignored as a comment,
but controls the command line argument (and thus ⎕ARG) of the interpreter.
The additional command line argument <samp>../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl</samp>
comes from function execve (see ’man 2 execve’).<p>If we provide an argument, say SCRIPTARG, to SCRIPT.apl:<pre class=verbatim>../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl SCRIPTARG
</pre><p>then it shows up at the end of ⎕ARG:<pre class=verbatim> /usr/local/bin/apl --script ../workspaces/SCRIPT.apl SCRIPTARG

</pre><p>A final note on scripting in GNU APL is that the ∇-editor works slightly
differently when it is used in a script. If a user edits an APL function
interactively then an attempt to open an existing function with a full
header gives a DEFN ERROR:<pre class=verbatim>      ∇Z←FOO B
[1] ∇

            ∇Z←FOO B
DEFN ERROR+
      ∇Z←FOO B
             ^
      )MORE
attempt to ∇-open existing function with new function header

</pre><p>In contrast to a user who can react to the DEFN ERROR, a script cannot detect
this situation and would continue to push lines (which were intended to be
the body of the defined function) into the APL interpreter. That would most
likely cause fairly undesirable behavior. For example, if the lines of a
defined function start with line numbers (like [1], [2], ...) then every
such line would give a SYNTAX ERROR, and other errors can be expected as
well.<p>For that reason, if the ∇-editor is used in a script and attempts to redefine
an existing defined function then the existing function is simply overwritten
with the new one and no DEFN ERROR is raised.<hr></div></div><div class=section id=Section-2_002e2><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Section-2_002e3 accesskey=n rel=next>Colored Output</a>, Previous: <a href=#Section-2_002e1 accesskey=p rel=prev>APL Scripting</a>, Up: <a href=#Chapter-2 accesskey=u rel=up>Non-standard GNU APL Features</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Axis-argument-in-defined-functions></span><h3 class=section>2.2 Axis argument in defined functions</h3><p>Defined functions and operators (including lambdas) accept an axis argument.

and > (but not of = or ≠) are integer or real numbers. As a consequence,
the argument(s) of ⍋ or ⍒ (which require comparison) must also be a vector
of integer or real numbers.<p>In contrast, GNU APL also allows the comparison of characters and numbers or
the comparison of complex numbers according to the following, more general,
rules.<p>Let A and B be two APL values to be compared. The final result of comparing
A and B is the first verdict (i.e. either A &lt; B, or A > B, or A = B)
obtained when following the rules below in the indicated order:<ol><li>Comparison by rank: if (⍴⍴A) &lt; (⍴⍴B) then A &lt; B and vice versa.<li>Comparison by shape: if (⍴A) &lt; (⍴B) then A &lt; B and vice versa. The
first differing shape item (from the left) decides.<li>Comparison of ravel elements: at this point (⍴A) ≡ (⍴B). If all
corresponding ravel elements of A and B are equal (i.e. tolerantly equal
within ⎕CT as defined in the ISO standard) then A = B.<p>Otherwise let A1 and B1 be the first corresponding ravel elements of A and B
with A1 ≠ B1. If A1 &lt; B1 then A &lt; B and vice versa. The comparison A1 &lt; B1
is made according to the following rules 4 - 8 below.<li>Comparison by depth:<ul><li>If A1 and B1 are both nested: the rules 1 - 3 above are (recursively)
applied to corresponding ravel elements of ⊃A1 and ⊃B1 until a verdict is
obtained.<li>if A1 is simple and B1 is nested then A &lt; B and vice versa.<li>otherwise (i.e. A1 and B1 are both simple): A &lt; B if A1 &lt; B1 according to
rules 5 - 8 below and vice versa.</ul><li>Comparison by Unicode: if A1 and B1 are both character values and
(⎕UCS A1) &lt; (⎕UCS B1) then A &lt; B and vice versa.<li>Comparison by type: If A1 is a character and B1 is numeric, then A &lt; B
and vice versa.<li>Comparison by numeric value: if A1 and B1 are both numeric values then:<ul><li>Comparison by real part: if (9○A1) &lt; (9○B1) then A &lt; B and vice versa.<li>Comparison by imaginary part: otherwise if (11○A1) &lt; (11○B1) then A &lt; B
and vice versa.</ul><li>Otherwise: A = B.</ol><p>Another way of describing the rules above is that the comparison of two values
is comprised of sub-comparisons of certain properties of the values in the
following order:<ul><li>the ranks of the values,<li>the shapes of the values,<li>the first differing ravel element (in row-major order) of the values,<li>the depths of the differing ravel elements,<li>the types (character vs. numeric) of the differing ravel elements,<li>the Unicodes of the differing ravel elements (if applicable)<li>the real parts of numeric values,<li>the imaginary parts of numeric values,</ul><p>Note: Rules 1 and 2 above are only relevant for comparisons made in the
context of sorting (i.e. for ⍋ or ⍒). This is because for =, ≠, &lt;, ≤, ≥,
or > either a RANK ERROR or a LENGTH ERROR is raised if the ranks or shapes
of A and B do not match:<pre class=verbatim>      (9 8) &lt; (1 2 3)
LENGTH ERROR
      9 8&lt;1 2 3
      ^  ^

      ⍋(9 8) (1 2 3)
1 2
</pre><p>The reason for comparing complex numbers first by their real parts and then
by their imaginary part and not, for example, first by their magnitude and
then by their angle is that the chosen order gives more consistent results
when comparing near-complex numbers or their true real companions. For
example, a magnitude first comparison of complex numbers would make
¯2 &lt; ¯1 &lt; ¯2J1E¯20 for the near-complex number ¯2J1E¯20.<p><b>CAUTION</b>: The comparison of two strings (i.e. nested character
vectors) may give unexpected results because shorter strings come before
longer strings. For example, ’Zoo’ comes <b>before</b> ’Adam’ even
though one might expect the opposite.<pre class=verbatim>      Z[⍋Z ← 'Adam' 'Zoo']
 Zoo Adam

      Z[⍋Z ← 'Adam' 'Zora']
 Adam Zora
</pre><p>This pitfall can be avoided by enforcing the same length for all strings
being compared or sorted. A simple way to achieve that is the use of
<b>⊂[2]⊃</b> like this (assuming IO←1):<pre class=verbatim>      Z[⍋Z ← ⊂[2]⊃ 'Adam' 'Zoo']
 Adam Zoo

      Z[⍋Z ← ⊂[2]⊃ 'Adam' 'Zora']

</pre><p>creates a named lambda. A body_statement can contain variable names ⍺ and ⍵
as well as function names ⍶ and ⍹ which are replaced by the actual arguments
of the lambda. If both ⍺ and ⍵ are present in body_statement then the lambda
is dyadic. If only ⍵ is present then it is monadic, and if neither ⍺ nor ⍵ is
present then the lambda is niladic.<p>Likewise, if ⍶ and ⍹ are present then the lambda is a dyadic operator. If only
⍶ is present then it is a monadic operator, and if neither ⍶ nor ⍹ is present
then the lambda is a normal function.<p>GNU APL supports an axis argument in normal user defined functions and
operators. In lambda expressions the Greek letter χ (Chi) is the variable
name for an axis argument.<p>The way a named lambda is implemented in GNU APL is that the expression<pre class=verbatim>      FUN ← { body_expression }
</pre><p>is translated to a two-line function ⎕FX ’lambda_header’ ’body_expression’.<p>For example:<pre class=verbatim>      )FNS

      )FNS
SUM

      ∇SUM[⎕]∇
[0] λ←⍺ SUM ⍵
[1] λ← ⍺ + ⍵

</pre><p>The lambda_header is automatically deduced from the presence or absence
of the variable names (⍺, ⍵, and χ) and function names (⍶ and ⍹) in the
body_expression and from whether the body_expression is empty (no λ←) or
not (with λ←).<p>It is possible to specify local variables that work exactly like their
companions in normal defined functions. Please note that this is different
from some other APL interpreters which treat all variables in lambda bodies
as local variables. The syntax for specifying local variables is the same
as for the header in normal defined functions: they are added at the end
with semicolons as separators. In the above example one could add local
variables C and D like this:<pre class=verbatim>      SUM ← { ⍺ + ⍵ ;C;D }

      ⎕CR 'SUM'
λ←⍺ λ1 ⍵;C;D
λ← ⍺ + ⍵

</pre><p>If a named lambda is created inside a function, then the name of the lambda
(i.e. the name left of ← { ... }) can be made a local variable of the
function in which the named lambda is created. This creates a lambda with
local scope.<p>Please note that the above only describes the current implementation of named
lambda in GNU APL. A consequence of that implementation is that the symbols
⍺, ⍵, χ, ⍶, ⍹, and λ are pretty much behaving like user defined variables. In
particular, they can be used outside named or unnamed lambdas. However, that
may change in the future and therefore such use of ⍺, ⍵, χ, ⍶, ⍹, and λ outside
is certainly a bad idea.</div><div class=subsection id=Unnamed-Lambdas><h4 class=subsection>2.7.2 Unnamed Lambdas</h4><p>An unnamed lambda is an expression inside { } but without assigning it to a
name. This is often used together with the EACH operator.
For example:<pre class=verbatim>      { ⍴ , ⍵ } ¨ 'a' 'ab' 'abc'
 1  2  3

</pre><p>Unnamed lambdas are automatically local in scope (similar to labels). They can
be passed as function arguments to operators. However, unnamed lambdas are NOT
inserted into the symbol table of the interpreter. They are therefore not
visible to functions like ⎕CR or by the ∇-editor. Occasionally the names λ1,
λ2, ... may show up in commands like )SIS. These names are automatically
generated for unnamed lambdas in order to provide a name in places where a

the hood, they share the same implementation: <b>structured variables</b> and
<b>associative arrays</b>.<ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#Structured-Variables accesskey=1>Structured Variables</a><li><a href=#Associative-Arrays accesskey=2>Associative Arrays</a></ul><div class=subsection id=Structured-Variables><h4 class=subsection>2.16.1 Structured Variables</h4><p>A structured variable is an APL variable that contains several related but
otherwise independent sub-variables aka. <b>members</b>. Such structured variables
can be convenient for passing many related arguments to a function, or
for returning multiple results from a function.<p>The different sub-variables of a structured variable are accessed by the
(top-level) name of the variable followed by a non-empty sequence of member
names, separated by ’.’. In the following we will use uppercase names for
structured variables and lowercase names for their members. For example:<pre class=verbatim>      PERSON.address.street
</pre><p>is a structured variable <b>PERSON</b>, which has a member <b>address</b>,
and <b>PERSON.address</b> is a structured (sub-)variable of PERSON which has
a member <b>street</b>.<p>For a structured variable and all its sub-variables, the usual rules for
normal variables apply. They can be created, erased, and even passed as
arguments to functions. <b>Nota bene</b>: Some GNU APL operators are implemented
as macros (i.e. internal defined APL functions). The macros may call APL
primitives that invalidate the fact that a value is structured and, as a
consequence, the operator results may become plain APL values. If this happens,
the structured nature of a plain APL value can be restored with 38 ⎕CR.<p>A structured variable is created by assigning a value to one of its members.
For example:<pre class=verbatim>      PERSON.firstname ← 'Jane' ⍝ create variable PERSON with member 'firstname'
      PERSON.lastname  ← 'Doe'  ⍝ add a second member 'lastname' to PERSON
</pre><p>The depth of a newly created member can be more than one. In this case the
intermediate members are created automatically. For example:<pre class=verbatim>      PERSON.address.street ← '42 Main Street' ⍝ implicitly creates PERSON.address
</pre><p>Empty structured variables can be created with <b>38 ⎕CR</b>:<pre class=verbatim>      EMPTY ← 38 ⎕CR CAPACITY ← 32
</pre><p>Note: A structured variable is automatically expanded when new members are
added to it. From time to time this expansion exceeds the space allocated
for the members of the variable and then the existing members need to be
copied into a new, larger structure. The overhead caused by this reorganization
can be avoided by specifying a sufficiently large capacity when the structure
is created (with <b>38 ⎕CR</b>).<p>An entire structured variable can be erased with <b>⎕EX</b> or with
<b>)ERASE</b> just like other variables. They erase the variable along
with all its members. In addition to erasing an entire structured variable,
individual members at any depth can also be erased with <b>⎕EX</b> or
<b>)ERASE</b>:<pre class=verbatim>      )ERASE PERSON.address      ⍝ OK, PERSON.address exists
      )ERASE PERSON.address      ⍝ error: PERSON.address does not exist anymore
NOT ERASED: PERSON.address
</pre><p>After having been created, the members of a structured variable can be
referenced and overwritten just like normal variables:<pre class=verbatim>      PERSON.address.street ←  '42 Main Street'   ⍝ create member address.street
      PERSON.address.street   ⍝ reference member address.street of PERSON
42 Main Street

      PERSON.address.street ←  '44 Main Street'   ⍝ overwrite address.street
      PERSON.address.street
44 Main Street
</pre><p>The members of a structured variable form a tree of (sub-) variables, similar
to the file system on a computer. This tree has:<ul><li>one root (which is the structured variable itself),<li>zero or more non-leafs (like sub-directories of the top-level root
directory), and<li>zero or more leafs. The case of zero non-leafs occurs, for example,
directly after a new empty variable was created with <b>38 ⎕CR</b>.</ul><p>Due to their tree-like structure, structured variables need to be printed
somewhat differently than normal APL variables. For example:<pre class=verbatim>      PERSON
.firstname: ┌→───┐
            │Jane│
            └────┘

.lastname: ┌→──┐
           │Doe│
           └───┘

.address:
.address.street: ┌→─────────────┐
                 │44 Main Street│
                 └──────────────┘
</pre><p>Only the leafs of a deeply structured variable can have values and, as a
precaution, assigning a value to a non-leaf (including the root) raises
a DOMAIN ERROR:<pre class=verbatim>      B.b.c←'leaf-Abc'        ⍝ OK, since B.b.c will be a leaf

      )SIC
</pre><p>On the other hand, assigning a structured variable to the leaf of another
structured variable is valid and concatenates the members:<pre class=verbatim>      )ERASE A
      A.b.c ← 'leaf-Abc'      ⍝ variable A with leaf A.b.c
      C.d.e ← 'leaf-cde'      ⍝ variable C with leaf C.d.e

is also the most efficient method. Many other languages provide, either in
addition or else alternatively, a method to index arrays by <b>keys</b>, where
the keys are frequently character strings. Such arrays are commonly referred
to as <b>associative arrays</b>.<p>APL has no associative array per se, but the structured variables in GNU APL
can be used for the same purpose. The only limitation is (currently) that the
keys need to be character strings (as opposed to arbitrary APL values).<p>That is, in GNU APL an associative array<ul><li>is a structured variable, and<li>can be indexed with arbitrary (!) strings</ul><p>As long as the strings that are used as keys follow the same rules as APL
variable names (no leading digit, no ’.’ etc.), a structured variable can
also be indexed with a string. That can be useful if keys are being computed
or passed as function arguments. However, unlike indexing of APL arrays with
numbers, only one key per (bracket-) index is permitted.<pre class=verbatim>   A.key ← 42

43
</pre><p>This is because ASSOC.key.dot above is being tokenized by the APL parser into
[ASSOC] [key] [dot], while ’key.dot’ is a single key. The example above (with
different values for ASSOC.key.dot and for ASSOC[’key.dot’] demonstrates why
such keys are better avoided.<p>Even though (one) bracket index can only access the top-level members of a
structured variable, repeated bracket index (or dyadic PICK) can be used to
access deeper nesting levels:<pre class=verbatim>      D.b.c←42

      'b' 'c' ⊃ D   ⍝ fails: 'b' 'c' is 'bc'
      "b" "c" ⊃ D   ⍝ works
42

</pre><p>In the above examples each bracket index (or each element of PICK) discards the
current top-level structure and descends into the structured sub-variable of
the chosen member. In this case PICK is more efficient since repeated bracket
index creates copies of the intermediate structured sub-variables.<p>If a variable is used as a structured variable then the number of its members
is typically small (since every member name occurs explicitly in the APL code
that uses it). If a variable is used as an associative array, then the member
names are typically being computed and the number of members can become rather
large (like the different key values in a database). When such a variable
(i.e. with many members) reaches its capacity, then finding a member (when
the array is indexed), or finding an unused place in the variable (when a new
member is added) becomes slower and slower. The GNU APL implementation has
addressed this by hashing into the variable (based on the member name)
instead of, for example, sequentially allocating the members. This is very
fast under normal circumstances, but becomes as slow as sequential allocation
when the number of members in the variable reaches its current capacity.
For this reason, if a structured variable is used as an associative array,
e.g. as a database, then it is better to not rely on the (automatic)
reorganization of the variable, but to create the variable with a large
enough (with 38 ⎕CR) from the beginning.<p>If that is not possible (because the (performance-) problem has occurred after
the variable was created, then one can manually increase the capacity like this:<pre class=verbatim>      TMP ← 39 ⎕CR ASSOC_ARRAY   ⍝ save ASSOC_ARRAY as normal APL array
      ⊣ ⎕EX 'ASSOC_ARRAY'        ⍝ erase it so that it can be assigned
      ASSOC_ARRAY ← 38 ⎕CR TMP   ⍝ new associative array with ≥ twice the size
</pre><p>As a rule of thumb, associative arrays will be fast as long their capacity is
more than twice the number of their members. The expression ASSOC_ARRAY[;1]
returns all keys (= members) of ASSOC_ARRAY, therefore the number of members
is ⍴ASSOC_ARRAY[;1] and the capacity is ↑⍴ASSOC_ARRAY.<hr></div></div><div class=section id=Section-2_002e17><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Section-2_002e18 accesskey=n rel=next>Bit-wise Logical Functions ⊤∧, ⊤∨, ⊤⍲, ⊤⍱, ⊤≠, and ⊤=</a>, Previous: <a href=#Section-2_002e16 accesskey=p rel=prev>Structured Variables and Associative Arrays</a>, Up: <a href=#Chapter-2 accesskey=u rel=up>Non-standard GNU APL Features</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Monadic-_005b_003f_005d-and-_22a3_002c-dyadic-_005b_003f_005d-with-Axis></span><h3 class=section>2.17 Monadic ⊢ and ⊣, dyadic ⊢ with Axis</h3><p>Monadic ⊢ is the identity function. It returns its (committed or non-committed)
right argument as a non-committed value.<p>Conversely, monadic ⊣ (called <b>Hide</b> in GNU APL) discards its (committed or
non-committed) right argument and returns a committed integer scalar 0.<p>For the most part there is no difference between a committed value (= a value
that was assigned to a variable, including ⎕ and ⍞) and a non-committed value.
The point where it does make a difference is when the value is the final result
of a statement (as opposed to an intermediate result inside a statement). In
that situation (and only there) a non-committed value is being printed while
a committed value is not.<p>You can use ⊢ in a similar fashion as ⎕← at the left end of a statement,
to print a value even though it was previously assigned to a variable.<p>The main motivation for ⊣ is that, at least in GNU APL, lambdas always return
a value. However, if a lambda is used only for the sake of its side effects,
say to print something, then the value returned by the lambda is often of no
interest and only messes up the APL output. In that situation ⊣ can be used
to suppress the printing of undesired return values from lambdas.<p>In earlier GNU APL versions, ⊣B and ⊢B would both return B; with ⊣ as committed
value and with ⊢ as non-committed value. But since the only real-life purpose
of ⊣ is to suppress the printing of B, the implementation of ⊣ was changed to
returning a committed integer scalar 0 instead of committed B. That reduced
the run-time of ⊣B from O(,B) to O(1). Also, ⊢B is marginally faster than ⎕←B.<p>Dyadic ⊢ with axis is a selection function that generalizes ⊣ and ⊢.<p>Let <b>Z←A ⊣[X] B</b>. Then:<ul><li>if X is a one-element vector and ↑X is 0 then Z ≡ A,<li>if X is a one-element vector and ↑X is 1 then Z ≡ B,<li>otherwise X selects items of A or B if the corresponding elements of
X are 0 or 1 respectively. In that case, the shapes of A and B must match
the shape of X, but one-element A or B are scalar extended to the shape of X.</ul><p>Example:<pre class=verbatim>      A←2 3⍴'abcdef'

Boolean integers. Primarily means that the LCM variant for ∧ and the GCD
variant for ∨ are not considered in this context. (The LCM and GCD variants
are defined in the ISO standard and supported in GNU APL but not in IBM APL2).<p>However, probably more often than not one needs to compute Boolean functions
between the bits of arbitrary (non-Boolean) integers and not between entire
Boolean integers 0 or 1. Although that is possible to do in standard APL,
the procedure is fairly awkward and, more importantly, inefficient:<ul><li>convert every integer argument X to a 64-item Boolean vector X←(64⍴2)⊤X,<li>call the Boolean function ∧, ∨, ⍲, ⍱, =, or ≠ with the converted arguments,
and<li>convert the Boolean result vector R back to the integer result Z←2⊥R</ul><p>Note: for Boolean arguments the APL functions ≠ and = can be used to compute
the more customary Boolean functions XOR and XNOR respectively. In this context
= and ≠ are treated as Boolean functions even though they accept non-Boolean
arguments,<p>For example, using 5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤X to display X in hex:<pre class=verbatim>      5 ⎕CR (4⍴256)⊤   A←$ABBADEAD

if their arguments are real or complex, then the smallest distance to
a (nearby) integer must not exceed the <b>integer tolerance</b>. In some contexts
that could be difficult to achieve and for that reason GNU APL provides
monadic ⊤∧ which works like ⊤∨ except that the permitted distance from a
nearby integer is now controlled by ⎕CT rather than by the integer tolerance.<p>All bit-wise logical functions throw a DOMAIN ERROR if an argument is not close
enough to an integer. The <b>integer tolerance</b> is typically smaller than ⎕CT

of the number of linearly independent columns of <b>B</b>. If that number is
smaller than the total number of columns (IOW some columns of <b>B</b> are
linearly dependent) then a <b>DOMAIN ERROR</b> is raised before the computation
of <b>⌹B</b> starts. Although <b>B</b> may be over-determined (so it may have more
rows than columns and in that case the rows of <b>B</b> cannot be linearly
independent) it may <i>not</i> have linearly dependent columns.<p>Now, for every real or complex number <b>⍺</b> does <b>⎕CT</b> define a range
of nearby numbers that are considered equal to <b>⍺</b> even though they are,
strictly speaking, different.<p>In the same fashion, let <b>B</b> be a matrix with linearly dependent columns.
For every such <b>B</b> does <b>⎕CT</b> define a range of nearby matrices that
are also considered linearly dependent even though they are, strictly
speaking, linearly independent. As a matter of fact, the probability
that the columns of <b>B</b> are strictly linearly independent decreases
as the size of the matrix grows. If a matrix has linearly dependent
columns, then every new row added to the matrix can make it linearly
independent, but not the other way around.<p>The consequence for the user of GNU APL is the following. If GNU APL raises
a <b>DOMAIN ERROR</b> caused by the supposedly linearly dependent columns of some
matrix <b>B</b> then there are two possibilities:<ol><li>the columns of <b>B</b> are indeed linearly dependent, e.g. <b>⌹B←2 2⍴3 4</b>.
In this case there is no way to compute <b>⌹B</b>.<li>the columns of <b>B</b> are only close (as controlled by <b>⎕CT</b>) to
some other strictly linearly dependent matrix. In this case (which
is far more likely than the other), one may decrease <b>⎕CT</b>
until the matrix becomes linearly independent. For example, <b>⌹B</b>
may raise a DOMAIN ERROR with the default <b>⎕CT←1E¯13</b> but not
with <b>⎕CT←1E¯15</b>.
However, one should use this technique with great care because
matrices that are nearly linearly dependent tend to produce
significant rounding errors in the result.</ol></div><div class=subsubsection id=g_t_005b_003f_005d_005bX_005d-B><h4 class=subsubsection>2.20.1.2 ⌹[X] B</h4><p>The integer scalar <b>X</b> chooses one of currently two different algorithms

a (N-2)×(N-2) matrix, and so forth. After every step of that recursion,
all matrix items close to 0.0 are set to exactly 0.0.<p>GNU APL uses <b>⎕CT</b> in the same way as the Helzer alogrithm, i.e. to decide
if a matrix item close to 0.0 shall be set to 0.0 or not (APL functions
<b>A TOL X</b> and <b>A CPR B</b>, where Helzer leaves it open how to
implement <b>A TOL X</b> and <b>A CPR B</b>). GNU APL uses the example
implementation given in the Helzer paper. The <b>TOL</b> and <b>CPR</b>

</pre><p>Recent versions of GNU APL have replaced the native FILE_IO function above by
the system function ⎕FIO. ⎕FIO need not be ⎕FX’ed and is otherwise backward
compatible to the native function. New function numbers are, however, only
added to ⎕FIO and not to the old native function FILE_IO. The parameters of
the functions are described in the man pages for, e.g. strerror, fopen, ...
and are fairly obvious.<p>Many functions in FILE_IO have byte vectors as arguments or return byte
vectors. A byte vector is an integer vector whose numbers fit into a byte
(so they are integers between -128 and 255). Often ⎕UCS and the functions in
dyadic ⎕CR are used to convert such byte vectors to/from, for example,
Unicode strings.<p>The GNU APL package also contains other shared libraries as templates
for your own native functions. Copy one of the files
src/native/template_F0.cc (for niladic native functions),
src/native/template_F12.cc (for nomadic native functions),
src/native/template_OP1.cc (for monadic native operators),
or src/native/template_OP2/cc (for dyadic native operators) to your own
.cc file and adjust src/native/Makefile.am accordingly.<p>Note: The )IN and )OUT commands of GNU APL support native functions, but
to do so they have to use dyadic ⎕FX. This renders the workspace
interchange file (.atf files) written by )OUT incompatible with all other
APL interpreters if the workspace contains native functions. The )OUT
command prints a warning when it is used with a workspace that contains
native functions.<p>Note: As of GNU APL 1.6, the native function FILE_IO has been turned into the
system function ⎕FIO. The syntax of ⎕FIO is the same as for FILE_IO. The
)CLEAR workspace command will close all open files.<hr></div><div class=section id=Section-2_002e23><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Section-2_002e24 accesskey=n rel=next>⎕DLX - Knuth’s Dancing Links Algorithm</a>, Previous: <a href=#Section-2_002e22 accesskey=p rel=prev>Dyadic ⎕FX (Native Functions)</a>, Up: <a href=#Chapter-2 accesskey=u rel=up>Non-standard GNU APL Features</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=g_t_005b_003f_005dARG-_002d-Interpreter-command-line-arguments></span><h3 class=section>2.23 ⎕ARG - Interpreter command line arguments</h3><p>⎕ARG contains the command line arguments with which GNU APL was invoked.

DLX by Knuth himself, but is sometimes also referred to as Knuth’s Algorithm X).
⎕DLX is a generic backtracking machine that can be used to dramatically
simplify problems like the 8 queens problem on a chess board or sudokus.<p>The monadic form of ⎕DLX, i.e. ⎕DLX B, is a shortcut for 0 ⎕DLX B. It
computes the first solution for the constraint matrix B.<p>The dyadic form of ⎕DLX, i.e. A ⎕DLX B, has an integer scalar A as left
argument which determines the details of the computation as follows:<p>A > 0: The algorithm tries to find all solutions, but stops when A solutions
have been found. This is handy while debugging code using ⎕DLX. The
result is a nested vector with one vector item per solution.<p>A = 0: The algorithm stops when the first solution was found. In this case
the solution is a simple (non-nested) numeric vector.<p>A = ¯1: like A > 0 but finding all solutions<p>A = ¯2: like A = 0 but instead of returning the first solution, the number of
solutions (i.e. 0 or 1), the number of backtracks, and the number of
link dances is returned as a 3-element numeric vector.<p>A = ¯3: like A = ¯1 but instead of returning all solutions, the number of
solutions, the number of backtracks, and the number of link dances is
returned as a 3-element numeric vector.<p>A = ¯4: A number of single steps in Knuth’s Algorithm are performed. Let e.g.
A←¯4 r1 r2 r3. Then Z←A ⎕DLX B is the matrix B after 3 steps r1, r2, and r3
have been performed. r1, r2, and r3 are valid (as per ⎕IO) row numbers of B,
and a step with a given row changes B as follows:<ul><li>the given row is set to 0 (this row becomes part of the final result),<li>all other rows that have a 1 or a 2 in the same column as B are set to 0
(these 1s or 2s in the other rows conflict with the 1 or 2 in the given row
and are therefore removed from B), and<li>all columns that have no 1s or 2s left are removed from B (these columns have
a 1 or 2 in B and the constraint is therefore satisfied).</ul><p>The purpose of ¯4 ⎕DLX is:<ul><li>To demonstrate how Knuth’s algorithm works, and/or<li>To preset some initial values in B. For example, one can first
initialize
the constraints for an empty Sudoku (which is the same matrix for all
Sudokus)
and then enter the initial digits of a particular Sudoku using 4 ⎕DLX.
If there are, say, 20 initial digits in the Sudoku then A has 21
elements (¯4 plus the
20 rows representing the 20 initial digits. The result of ¯4 ⎕DLX B has
the
same number of rows as B (with some rows now cleared), but fewer columns
than B.</ul><p>The right argument B of ⎕DLX B or A ⎕DLX B is a constraints matrix whose
columns consist of either 0s and 1s (called a primary column) or 0s and 2s
(called secondary columns). The 0s, 1s and 2s can be the integers 0, 1, or 2,
characters ’0’, ’1’, or ’2’ respectively, or ’ ’ meaning ’0’. The character
representation is useful when B becomes large and shall be printed because
the spaces in the numerical variant will not be printed. In the following,
B is assumed to be numeric.<p>Let Z←A ⎕DLX B, and let R be a solution in Z, that is, Z itself (A = 0) or
R is Z[k] for some k if A ≠ 0. And let S←+⌿B[R].<p>Then S = s1 s2 s3, ... sN where N is the number of columns in B and sj=1
if j is a primary column of B and sj∈0 1 if j is a secondary column of B.<p>In other words, ⎕DLX B computes a subset of the rows of B in such a way that
for every column j of B exactly one (for primary column j) or at most one
(for a secondary column) of the rows in a solution has its j’th element set
to 1 and all other words set their j’th element set to 0.<p>In yet other words, for every solution returned by ⎕DLX B, a 1 in one row
prevents all other rows that also have a 1 in that column, and all rows
together have exactly one 1 in every primary column and at most one 1 in
every secondary column. In the absence of secondary columns, the problem
solved by ⎕DLX is also known as the "exact cover problem"<p>If all that sounds weird and useless, consider the following APL program
for finding all solutions of the 8 Queens problem on a chess board (which
probably every programmer has programmed at some point in time):<pre class=verbatim>      RC←8↑'1' ◊ D←15↑¯8↑'2'   ⍝ helpers for constructing Q8

</pre><p>Obviously Z contains solutions for the 8 Queens problem; the total number of
solutions is well known to be 92 and we showed only the first two and the
last solution above.<p>The constraint matrix Q8 is the key to success. The matrix has 64 rows - one
row for every field of the chess board. And it has 8 + 8 + 15 + 15 columns.
The first 8 columns of Q8 are constraints that prevent more than one Queen
from being placed in the same row of the chess board (the argument ⍵ is the
field number counting from left to right and from bottom to top).
The next 8 columns of Q8 are constraints that prevent more than one Queen
from being placed in the same column of the chess board.<p>If we would call ⎕DLX with only these constraints, i.e. ⎕DLX T8←64 16↑Q8,
then we would get the solutions of the 8 tower problem. However, we continue
and add 15 more constraints for each of the two diagonals. The resulting

It computes
the FFT of complex or real B without applying a window function.<p>The dyadic form A ⎕FFT B provides more control over what ⎕FFT computes. A is
an integer scalar which falls into one of three ranges.<p>The first range from ¯15 to ¯10 does not compute an FFT, but returns the result
of multiplying B with one of several window functions, that are frequently
used in the context of FFTs. The result has same shape as B and can be used for
analyzing or troubleshooting FFTs:<ul><li>A=¯10: no FFT, return the Hann window applied to B<li>A=¯11: no FFT, return the Hamming window applied to B<li>A=¯12: no FFT, return the Blackman window applied to B<li>A=¯13: no FFT, return the Blackman-Harris window applied to B<li>A=¯14: no FFT, return the Blackman-Nuttal window applied to B<li>A=¯15: no FFT, return the Flat-Top window applied to B</ul><p>The second range around 0 contains the computation of the forward and inverse
FFTs:<ul><li>0 ⎕FFT B returns the "normal" (aka. forward) FFT of the numeric array B.<li>¯1 ⎕FFT B returns the inverse FFT of the numeric array B.</ul><p>The third range from 10 to 15 corresponds to the first range and first
multiplies B with a window function and then computes the FFT:<ul><li>A=10: FFT(B × Hann window)<li>A=11: FFT(B × Hamming window)<li>A=12: FFT(B × Blackman window)<li>A=13: FFT(B × Blackman-Harris window)<li>A=14: FFT(B × Blackman-Nuttal window)<li>A=15: FFT(B × Flat-Top window)</ul><p>⍴⍴B can be 1 (one-dimensional FFT, the most common case) or more. The
implementation of ⎕FFT uses libfftw3, aka. "The fastest Fourier Transform in
the West." GNU APL checks the presence of libfftw3 when it is ./configure’d.
If libfftw3 is present then ⎕FFT will hopefully return the expected result;
if not then a DOMAIN ERROR will be raised when ⎕FFT is being used.<p>⎕FFT honors the presence of /etc/fftw/wisdom (see man fftw-wisdom) to speed
up the computations performed by ⎕FFT. Creating /etc/fftw/wisdom will take a
few hours, though, so that creating it will not pay off for most mortals.<hr></div><div class=section id=Section-2_002e28><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Section-2_002e29 accesskey=n rel=next>⎕JSON - JSON Parsing</a>, Previous: <a href=#Section-2_002e27 accesskey=p rel=prev>⎕FFT - Fast Fourier Transform</a>, Up: <a href=#Chapter-2 accesskey=u rel=up>Non-standard GNU APL Features</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=g_t_005b_003f_005dGTK-_002d-GTK-Interface></span><h3 class=section>2.28 ⎕GTK - GTK Interface</h3><p>GTK (Gimp ToolKit) is a rather powerful library for creating graphical user

A[N;2] (which may or may not be nested). If a (nested or not nested) key A[N;1]
is equal to an item in B, then the corresponding item in the result will be
nested if A[N;2] is nested. If, for some N, the depths of A[N;1] and A[N;2]
differ, then depths of B and A ⎕MAP B may differ as well. That is, ⎕MAP
conserves the shape of B, but not necessarily the depth of B.<li>By default the mapping of B is non-recursive, i.e. the top-level items of
B are compared with the top-level keys A[;1], and nested keys and items of B

</pre><p>There are 2 kinds of attributes: global attributes that affect the entire
plot, and local (per-line) attributes that affect one of the plot lines
(which corresponds to one row of B). One way to specify
multiple attributes in one go is to use multi-line strings.<p>For example (plot 2 lines of 10 random numbers each, named "random row 1" and
"random row 2"):<pre class=verbatim>      Data ← ?2 10⍴10   ⍝ two rows of random data
      Attributes  ← """
legend_name-1: Random Row 1
legend_name-2: Random Row 2
                    """
      Attributes ⎕PLOT Data
</pre><p>While specifying the plot attributes A in one place is most convenient for
a single plot window or when the attributes are read from some external
test file, its is sometimes simpler to specify the plot attributes
individually. This can be done by using a structured APL variable as left
argument A:<pre class=verbatim>Attributes.legend_name_1 ← "Random Row 1"
Attributes.legend_name_2 ← "Random Row 2"
      Attributes ⎕PLOT Data
</pre><p>Note that (for syntactical reasons) the separation between the line attribute
and the line number is <b>_</b> (underscore) if <b>A</b> is specified as
a structured APL value and <b>-</b> (minus) if A is specified as a string
of lines.<p>If the global attribute <b>output_filename</b> is given, then the plot is
not only being displayed in a window on the screen, but also written
to a file with the name of the file provided as attribute value.
See <a href=#Output-File-Format>Output File Format</a> below.<p>For example:<pre class=verbatim>      ⊣ ( ⊂ "output_filename: /tmp/bitmap.png" ) ⎕PLOT 1 3 1 4 2
</pre><p>writes the plot of a a zigzag curve to file <b>/tmp/bitmap.png</b>.<p><b>Caution</b>: ⎕PLOT with attribute <b>output_filename</b> overwrites existing
files without any warning). Errors, most likely lack of permissions to write
the output file, raises a DOMAIN ERROR with )MORE possibly providing details
as to why the file could not be written.<p>Some line attributes such as <b>line_width</b> or <b>point_size</b> are
frequently the same for several or even all plot lines. In that case one can
use the line attribute without a -N or _N suffix which is then used as the
default for all lines (unless overridden by the same attribute with -N or
_N suffix.<p>For example:<pre class=verbatim>Attributes.line_width   ← 2   ⍝ all plot lines:     2 pixels thick,
Attributes.line_width_2 ← 4   ⍝ except plot line 2: 4 pixels thick

two different types of tick items: static and dynamic.<p>A <b>static tick item</b> starts with <b>%s</b>, followed by one or more texts,

the origin and proceeding along the axis. For example:<p>ATT.format_X ← ’%sT1%T2%T3’<p>will name X-axis ticks <b>T1</b>, <b>T2</b>, and <b>T3</b>, regardless of the X
coordinate. <b>static tick items</b> are the fallbacks for those cases where
<b>dynamic tick items</b> cannot produce the desired result. In other
words, <b>static tick items</b> must be constructed in APL beforehand.<p>In contrast, <b>dynamic tick items</b> are computed from the value at the
axis, which is often simpler than computing them beforehand in APL. A
format string may contain 0 or more tick items which are used in a printf()
like manner.<p>Most of the <b>dynamic tick items</b> (see <b>⎕PLOT ⍬</b> for a complete list)
are related to points in time (years, quarters, months, days, hours, minutes,
and seconds). For them the X coordinate (time) is, according to the *nix time
conventions, seconds since midnight 1970. Since this number of seconds is not
easy to compute in APL, <b>⎕FIO.secs_epoch</b> comes to rescue:<pre class=verbatim>Q1  ← ⎕FIO.secs_epoch 2023 2 15   ⍝ Feb. 15 (middle of Q1) 00:00:00

guessing the X-values between the vertical grid lines. This can be achieved
with setting <b>gridX_variable</b> to 1. Usually the X-coordinates are evenly

top-right corner) of the plot window,<li>interactively by opening the drop down menu (if any) of the window
(near the top left-of the window) and selecting the menu option named
<b>Close</b>,<li>programmatically from APL by calling <b>⎕PLOT ¯3</b> (which closes <b>all</b>

perfect language for manipulating images. In GNU APL (and also in the PNG
standard) a single pixel may have one, two, three, or four color components,
or short colors, as follows:<ul><li>a pixel with <strong>one</strong> color defines an uncolored (grayscale)
pixel between black and white,<li>a pixel with <strong>two</strong> colors defines a grayscale pixel between
black and white, and its opacity (see below),<li>a pixel with <strong>three</strong> colors defines a colored pixel whose colors
are red, green and blue (or RGB for short), and<li>a pixel with <strong>four</strong> colors defines an RGB pixel and its opacity
(RGBA for short).</ul><p>The opacity (sometimes called the "alpha channel" and abbreviated A in the
RGBA format) defines how transparent a pixel is; lower values cause the
background of a pixel to shine through while larger values make the pixel
more opaque. One important use of the alpha channel is images that shall
not appear rectangular (even though their underlying color matrix is).
For example, to display a red circle on top of something else, one can set
the opacity of the pixels inside the circle to their maximum (as to making
them fully opaque and completely hiding the background or some other image
below) and the pixels outside the circle to 0 (making them fully transparent).<p>Since every pixel of an image may have 1, 2, 3, or 4 color components, the
representation of an image in APL is a three dimensional array
<strong>Image</strong> where:<ul><li><strong>(COLORS HEIGHT WIDTH) ← ⍴ IMAGE</strong>,<li><strong>COLORS</strong> is a number that determines <strong><em>general
format</em></strong> of the image (and, by chance, the number of its color components):<ul><li><strong>COLORS = 1</strong>: a grayscale image,<li><strong>COLORS = 2</strong>: a grayscale image with an alpha channel,<li><strong>COLORS = 3</strong>: a colored RGB (red/green/blue) image, or<li><strong>COLORS = 4</strong>: a colored RGB image with an alpha channel,
aka. RGBA)</ul><li><strong>Height</strong> is the number of pixels of the image in the vertical
direction, and<li><strong>Width</strong> is the number of pixels of the image in the horizontal
direction.</ul><p>Above is: <strong>WIDTH</strong> the number of pixels in the horizontal direction,
<strong>HEIGHT</strong> the number of the pixels in the vertical direction, and
<strong>COLORS</strong> the number of color components as above. For simplicity we
can treat the opacity as yet another color although, strictly speaking, it
is not.<p>For an image I, the horizontal pixel position I[;;x] increases from left to
right and the vertical pixel position I[;y;] increases from top to bottom.<p>In addition to the 4 general image formats above, the PNG standard allows
each format to have different resolutions (of 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit,
and 16-bit, even though not all combinations of image format and resolution
are permitted. For example, the lower resolutions (of 1-bit, 2-bit, or 4-bit)
are only permitted for grayscale images without alpha channel, 16-bit is
allowed for all images except those with a color table, and so on.<p>In theory there are 20 different combinations of 4 general image formats and
5 resolutions of the color components. However, the PNG standard allows only
15 of them, in particular by permitting 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit resolutions only
for grayscale images without alpha channel. The GNU APL color model reduces
these 15 combinations further to the 4 general types with the following rules:<ul><li>On input, i.e. when reading a PNG image file and producing the APL
array described above, the different resolutions allowed by the PNG standard
are normalized to a single range of real numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 (this
is by chance also the range used in the GTK standard used in ⎕PNG and ⎕PLOT).<li>Also on input, images that use color tables (for compressing the
image to reduce the file size) are automatically expanded. The resulting
APL value is therefore independent of the use of color tables.<li>On output, i.e. when storing the APL array in a PNG file, the
resolution is 8-bit by default. 8-bit is the only resolution which is valid
for all image formats in the PNG standard.<li>Also on output, one may optionally specify a different resolution.</ul><p>In GNU APL, integers and floating point numbers take the same space in
memory. The advantage of smaller PNG files with lower resolutions would
therefore disappear as soon as converted to APL. On the other hand, the
disadvantage (primarily different max. values for different resolutions)
would remain. In the GNU APL color model a purely red RGB pixel has the same
value <strong>I[;y[x] ← 1.0 0.0 0.0</strong> regardless of resolution, which
simplifies matters considerably. In a PNG file that same red RGB pixel
would instead have either:<ul><li>the value $01 0 0 in a 1-bit RGB image, or<li>the value $03 0 0 in a 2-bit RGB image, or<li>the value $07 0 0 in a 4-bit RGB image, or<li>the value $FF 0 0 in a 8-bit RGB image, or<li>the value $FFFF 0 0 in a 16-bit RGB image.</ul><p>It may be useful to note that the human eye can only distinguish around 120
different colors, i.e. about 7 bits (for all color planes together). For this
reason 16-bit color components are quite an overkill and the 8-bit default
therefore should be more than sufficient for most purposes.</div><div class=subsection id=Monadic-_005b_003f_005dPNG><h4 class=subsection>2.32.2 Monadic ⎕PNG</h4><p>Monadic ⎕PNG, i.e. ⎕PNG B is used for 3 purposes:<ul><li>Conversion of PNG files into the GNU APL color model,<li>Display of an APL array (in the GNU APL color model) in a window on
the screen (interactive use of PNG), and<li>Controlling of ⎕PNG itself.</ul><p>The desired purpose is dictated by the properties of <strong>B</strong>:<ul><li>Any APL text vector (i.e. a string) <strong>B</strong> is taken as the name of
a file that supposedly contains an image in the PNG format. ⎕PNG will
read the file and return the pixels in it as a numeric APL array of rank 3.
The array contains the color components of the image in the file as
described above.<li>Any array <strong>B</strong> with rank 3 must be numeric (with values from
0.0 to 1.0) and is then assumed to be an array in the GNU APL color model
(such as the result of the case above). This image is displayed in a new
window on the screen; the window survives even after ⎕PNG has returned.
The result returned by ⎕PNG is a window handle (a positive integer
identifying the window) which may later be used (in the case described
below) to close the window programmatically from APL. Alternatively the
window can also be closed interactively by the user via its close button.<li>Finally, if <strong>B</strong> is a numeric scalar it fine-tunes the ⎕PNG
behaviour:<ul><li>⎕PNG N with N ≥ 1 (as returned in the case above) closes the window
with handle N programmatically.<li>⎕PNG 0 disables all debug printouts related to ⎕PNG.<li>⎕PNG ¯1 turns on a debug printout related to ⎕PNG (X events).<li>⎕PNG ¯2 turns on a debug printout related to ⎕PNG (image data).<li>⎕PNG ¯3 closes all open ⎕PNG windows.<li>⎕PNG ¯4 turns on a debug printout related to ⎕PNG (GTK drawing).<li>⎕PNG ¯5 turns on a debug printout related to ⎕PNG (function calls).<li>⎕PNG ¯6 returns a vector of all all open ⎕PNG window handles.</ul></ul></div><div class=subsection id=Dyadic-_005b_003f_005dPNG><h4 class=subsection>2.32.3 Dyadic ⎕PNG</h4><p>Dyadic <strong>A ⎕PNG B</strong> has only one purpose: to store an APL array in

then the nested <strong>A1</strong> is the name of a PNG file as before and

as defined for the libpcre2 library. ⎕RE passes its left argument A unmodified
to libpcre2. The format of A ranges from very simple REs to very complex REs.
In fact, regular expressions are a language of their own, and it is unnecessary
to describe them here. The user of ⎕RE is referred to the description that

the EACH operator had been applied to ⎕RE:<pre class=verbatim>    A ⎕RE B   ←→   A ⎕RE ¨ B
</pre><p>The libpcre2 first compiles A into an internal representation that improves
the matching (of B) speed. As a consequence, if several strings shall be matched
with the same regular expression A, then it is (sometimes considerably) faster
to A ⎕RE B once with several items of a nested B, than to A ⎕RE B multiple
times with the same A but different Bs. This is especially true when longer
text files with many lines will be matched.<p>If multiple (nested) strings B are used then A is compiled once and after that
the different ⊃B[i] in B are passed unmodified to libpcre2. In that case the
result Z is nested and (⍴B) ≡ (⍴Z←A ⎕RE[X] B). We can therefore limit the

did not have (regular) sub-expressions. In other words, the regular expression
A did not contain non-literal (unquoted) parentheses. However, the libpcre2
allows sub-expressions and ⎕RE follows suit to a certain extent. If A contains
sub-expressions, the result of A ⎕RE B becomes deeper and the structure of the
result is determined by the structure of the parentheses in A.<p>The result of a general regular expression A is recursively constructed by ⎕RE
as follows:<p>1. If A contains no sub-expressions then the result is constructed as described
in the previous sections.<p>2. If A contains sub-expressions, say A1, ... An, then the result is a (nested)
vector with N+1 elements where the first element is the entire match (which
contains the sub-matches) and the following elements are the next-level
sub-matches.<p>Since the sub-matches are contained in their parent matches, it makes no sense
to handle sub-matches in the partition and compress output formats. For the
string and pos+len formats, the following examples may give some insight into
how the results look.<p>The regular expression A ← ’f(.)(.)’ used in the example below is a top-level

aka. <b>Roll</b>. Roll returns a simple random array whose ravel elements are
positive integers chosen in a (pseudo-) random fashion. While this is sufficient
for many applications, one sometimes needs APL values whose randomness not
only affects the ravel elements themselves, but also other aspects like:<ul><li>the rank of the value,<li>the shape of the value,<li>the data type of the ravel elements, and<li>the depth (nesting) of the values.</ul><p>Such values can be produced with system function ⎕RVAL. The main use case for

useful for other purposes as well.<ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#General accesskey=1>General</a><li><a href=#Dyadic-_005b_003f_005dRVAL accesskey=2>Dyadic ⎕RVAL</a></ul><div class=subsection id=General><h4 class=subsection>2.35.1 General</h4><p>In general, monadic ⎕RVAL B, returns a single random APL value Z,
while dyadic A RVAL B is used to control the properties of
subsequently generated random APL values returned by monadic ⎕RVAL.<p>The typical use of ⎕RVAL is to first call A ⎕RVAL B zero or more times to
override individual default properties of the subsequently produced values,
followed by one or more calls of monadic ⎕RVAL B.<p>The default properties, i.e. the properties used unless they were overridden
by dyadic A ⎕RVAL B, are:<pre class=verbatim>Rank:  0

For this reason ⎕RVAL is
only available on platforms which use glibc, for example all GNU/Linux
systems.<p>Every random number generator has a state (similar to ⎕RL for ’?’). While
the primitive ? keeps its state in ⎕RL, i.e. in the workspace, ⎕RVAL has
no associated system variable like ⎕RL which keeps its state. Instead,
the user needs to store the state of ⎕RVAL in a workspace variable if the
workspace shall be stored and continued at a later point. This rarely happens,
therefore no effort was spent for implementing another system variable. For
the same reason, the state of ⎕RVAL survives )CLEAR.<p>The current state of ⎕RVAL’s random number generator can be retrieved
with:<pre class=verbatim>      STATE ← 0 ⎕RVAL ''
</pre><p>The state changes with every call of monadic ⎕RVAL. The random number generator
can later be restored to the same state like this:<pre class=verbatim>      0 ⎕RVAL STATE
</pre><p>Restoring the state is needed when the same sequence of random values shall
be generated again. The random number generators of ? and ⎕RVAL are
independent; generating a random number or random value with one does not
change the state of the other.</div><div class=subsubsection id=Control-of-the-ranks_003a-1-_005b_003f_005dRVAL-B><h4 class=subsubsection>2.35.2.2 Control of the ranks: 1 ⎕RVAL B</h4><p>The rank of subsequently generated random values can be controlled with

./configurable constant with a default of 8.<li>If B is a negative scalar with 0 > B > -MAX_RANK then the ranks of the
subsequently generated random values will be chosen at random between
0 and -B (inclusive). All possible ranks 0 ... B will have the same
probability P = 100÷1-B %.<li>Otherwise B must be a vector of positive integers. The integers are the
relative frequencies of the ranks 0, 1, ... MAX_RANK respectively. Too many
integers (i.e. MAX_RANK > ⍴B) will raise a LENGTH ERROR while fewer (than
MAX_RANK) are set to 0.</ul><p>1 ⎕RVAL always returns its previous setting (i.e. before applying B).
An empty B, e.g. 1 ⎕RVAL ⍬ will not change anything and can be used to

probability of 100÷3 %, and<li>1 ⎕RVAL 50 30 20 will produce scalars with probability 50%, vectors

2 ⎕RVAL B as follows.<p>B must be a vector of positive or negative integers. Vectors longer than
MAX_RANK + 1 will give a LENGTH ERROR while vectors shorter than MAX_RANK + 1
will be filled with 1 until the length of B becomes MAX_RANK + 1.<p>If an element B<sub>i</sub> of the resulting shape B = B<sub>1</sub> ... B<sub>MAXRANK</sub>

random).<p>2 ⎕RVAL always returns its previous setting (i.e. before applying B).
An empty B, e.g. 2 ⎕RVAL ⍬, will not change anything and can be used to

shall be able to handle advanced XML aspects (like document type
declarations (DTDs), document validation, etc.) in APL without much overhead.</ul></div><div class=subsection id=Some-XML-Terminology><h4 class=subsection>2.39.2 Some XML Terminology</h4><p>An XML document is a character string with a standardized format.
The characters must be valid XML characters as defined in the XML
standard (almost all Unicode characters except most of the ASCII control
characters). GNU APL raises a DOMAIN ERROR when an XML document contains
invalid XML characters.<p>The XML document is a sequence of adjacent sub-strings, where each sub-string
is:<ul><li>either markup (-string),<li>or non-markup (-string).</ul><p>A markup (sub-)string:<ul><li>starts with character ’&lt;’, and<li>ends with character ’>’, and<li>all other characters in the markup string differ from ’&lt;’ and ’>’.</ul><p>A non-markup (sub-)string:<ul><li>starts either at the beginning of the XML document or else directly
after a markup string,<li>end at the end of the document or else directly before a markup
string, and therefore<li>cannot be adjacent to another non-markup string.</ul><p>Non-markup is sometimes referred to as "unstructured text". The producer of
an XML document has a principal choice about where to locate the information
that the document contains: in the unstructured text or in the attribute
values inside the tags. For that reason the XML standard is somewhat picky
about keeping the unstructured text as well as attribute values intact
and requires that whitespace in non-markup (the only allowed whitespace
characters in XML being TAB, CR, LF, and SPACE) is preserved in non-markup
strings.<p>As a consequence, many non-markup strings begin with LF because the
preceeding markup was on the previous line and therefore the LF after the
preceeding markup is whitespace of the non-markup and therefore needs to be
preserved.<p>Every markup belongs to one of 4 categories:<ul><li>Processing instructions: "&lt;? ... ?>",<li>Comments: "&lt;!— ... —>",<li>Declarations "&lt;! ... !>", and<li>Tags, which are either:<ul><li>Empty tags (leaf tags): "&lt;tagname attributes... /><li>Start tags: "&lt;tagname attributes... >, or<li>End tags: "&lt;/tagname></ul></ul><p>The XML tags recursively define a tree structure where:<ul><li>the nodes of the trees are either Empty Tags or else a start tag,
followed by a (possibly empty) sequence of non-markup, comments, and
sub-nodes (of the tree), followed by an end tag (with the same name
as the start tag),<li>the leafs of the trees are either Empty Tags or else a start tag,
followed by a (possibly empty) sequence of non-markup and comments,
followed by an end tag (with the same name as the start tag). The difference
between a leaf node and a non-leaf is therefore the absence of sub-nodes
between a start and an end tag.<li>optionally non-markup and comments before, after, and between the nodes.</ul><p>Processing instructions and declarations are typically located at the
beginning of the XML document and at the same level as the root of the tree.
defined by the document. Document type declarations are being preserved (so
that they can be processed in APL), but are currently ignored by ⎕XML. As a
consequence, entity declarations have no effect and only the predefined XML
entities (i.e. &, &lt;, >, ’, and ") are recognized (and translated) by ⎕XML.</div><div class=subsection id=How-_005b_003f_005dXML-maps-XML-documents-to-APL-Values><h4 class=subsection>2.39.3 How ⎕XML maps XML documents to APL Values</h4><p>The principal mapping between XML strings and APL values is:<ul><li><b>XML document</b> ←→ structured (top-level) APL value or variable
(= an associative array)<li><b>XML node</b> ←→ structured APL (sub-) value (= an associative (sub-)
array of either the top-level value or of another XML node)<li><b>XML name</b> ←→ name of a member in a structured APL value<li><b>Other</b> ←→ member value</ul><p>Every valid name in XML is also a valid name for an APL variable or structure
member. Unfortunately, mapping XML names directly to APL member names cannot
work because:<ul><li>In any associative array the names of the members are necessarily
distinct. Assigning a value to an already existing member of a structured
value overwrites the current value of that member instead of creating a
second member with that value. On the other hand, in XML nodes tags may (and
frequently do) occur repeatedly. If an XML document contains several nodes
with the same tag, then the applications usually knows how to interpret the
order in which the tags occur, but this order may not be detectable at the XML
level (i.e. the nodes may not only have the same tag names, but also the same
attributes and attribute values).<p>The applications that use the XML document frequently require that the order
of XML nodes with the same name remain intact when the document is modified.
For example, the entries of a telephone book may be sorted alphabetically
without XML being aware of that. Reading, modifying, and writing back the
data in the telephone book must therefore not destroy that order.<li>Likewise, at least for readability reasons, the order of node
attributes should not be changed. XML documents are frequently processed
with text tools like <b>diff</b> which would incorrectly show differences
between XML documents that are equivalent from an XML perspective.<li>Conflicts between tag names and attribute names. In XML, the same name
can designate an attribute in one node and a tag in another node. ⎕XML keeps
all information from the &lt; of a start tag to the > of an end tag in a single
associative array, therefore the attribute names must somehow differ from
the (sub-) tag names.<li>Every XML node has a tag name that can be used to derive a
corresponding APL member name. However, the text segments between an XML
tag and its corresponding end tag, are a mixture of unstructured text, XML
subnodes and comments of which only the XML subnodes have tags of their own.
These untagged segments may, however, contain relevant information and,
from an XML standard perspective, both their content and their order must
be preserved.</ul><p>⎕XML solves these issues with a simple naming convention for all member names
in the (recursive) associative array that is produced by monadic ⎕XML. Every
member name consists of 3 components that together yield a valid APL variable
name (and therefore a valid member name that is understood by the APL parser):<ul><li>A single character ⍙, ∆, or _, that indicates the role of the name in
the XML document as follows:<ul><li>the character ⍙ characterizes an attribute name, i.e. a name that
was used <b>inside</b> (i.e. between &lt; and >) of an XML start or leaf tag.
The character ⍙ alone is the name of a special member which is present
in every associative array below the top-level and whose value is the
original XML tag name of a tag, or<li>the character ∆ characterizes a name that was synthesized by ⎕XML
itself in order to tag a text (sub-) segment that has no tag of its own. The
corresponding XML entity was not a tag (and therefore had no tag name), or<li>the character _ characterizes the name of an XML entity, i.e. a CML
name that occurred <b>between</b> the start tag and the corresponding end tag
(if any: leaf tags have no such entities)</ul><li>a position prefix of the form <b>NN</b>, where NN is the position
of the member in relation to the tag to which it belongs. The numbering
starts at ⎕IO and restarts at every XML start or leaf tag.<li>the attribute name or tag name. For those parts of an XML entity that
do not have a tag name, the member name is being synthesized by ⎕XML and the
member value will be the text in the XML document with predefined XML
entities replaced by their single characters, i.e.:<ul><li>& for &amp;amp,<li>&lt; for &amp;lt,<li>> for &amp;gt,<li>’ for &amp;apos,<li>" for &amp;quot,<li>⎕UCS nnn for &amp;#nnn, and<li>⎕UCS $xxx for &amp;#xxx</ul></ul><p>Let NN be a sequence of decimal digits. Then only the following 4
synthesized names are produced by ⎕XML:<ul><li><b>∆NNcomment</b> for XML comments, i.e. &lt;!— ... —> in XML,<li><b>∆NNdeclaration</b> for XML declarations, i.e. &lt;? ... ?> in XML,<li><b>∆NNdoctype</b> for document type declarations, i.e.
&lt;!DOCTYPE ... > in XML<li><b>∆NNtext</b> for unstructured (and hence untagged) text segements in XML.</ul><p>Every XML name (of a tag or attribute) is also a valid APL name, but
valid APL names may also contain the characters ¯, ∆, and ⍙ which are not
valid in XML and used in the naming convention above to clearly separate
the member names used in APL from the names used in the XML document.<p>The essence of all this is that <b>everything</b> that belongs to an XML
node or document, i.e. the attributes inside a tag, the sub-nodes between a
start tag and its corresponding end tag (if any), declarations, etc. will
be contained in a single associative array.<p>Examples of APL member names (assuming ⎕IO←1):<pre class=verbatim>      ⍙1              ⍝ the first member in every XML node. Its value is the node tag.
      ∆1declaration   ⍝ the first member in most XML documents. E.g. &lt;?xml version= ...&gt;
      ∆2text          ⍝ whitespace (LF) between _1∆declaration and _3∆doctype

avoid them, wherever possible, in favour of portability. Neither the ISO
APL standard, nor IBM APL2 provide conditionals.<ul class=section-toc><li><a href=#Design-considerations_002e accesskey=1>Design considerations.</a><li><a href=#Syntax-1 accesskey=2>Syntax</a></ul><div class=subsection id=Design-considerations_002e><h4 class=subsection>2.40.1 Design considerations.</h4><p>The author of GNU APL has, for a long time, hesitated to implement
conditionals in GNU APL. Primarily for the following reasons:<ul><li>the lack of standardization of conditionals,<li>the lack of an elegant syntax that fits well into the typical
(brief) APL programming style, and in particular<li>the large number of keywords for flow control used in some other APL
interpreters. See below.</ul><p>The C language has 6 keywords for flow control: <b>if</b>, <b>else</b>, <b>for</b>,
<b>do</b>, Two of them (<b>do</b> and <b>while</b>) are redundant and rarely used,
leaving only 4 base cases. A quick <b>grep -c</b> over the 90000 top-level C++
source code lines of GNU APL reveals the following statistics:<ul><li>7000 <b>if</b> statements, 1600 of them two-sided if-then-else-endif,
the others one-sided if-then-endif,<li>2000 <b>for</b> statements, 1200 of them trivial iterations over some
array (aka. <i>for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) ... </i>,<li>200 <b>switch</b> statements with an averge of 8 case clauses per switch,<li>250 <b>while</b> statements, and<li>70 <b>do while</b> statements</ul><p>In contrast, a popular non-free APL interpreter came up with a zoo of 30
or so keywords for the purpose of flow control in one way or the other:<p>:If :While :Repeat :For :In :InEach :Select :With :Trap :Hold :Disposable
:Else :ElseIf :AndIf :OrIf :Until :Case :CaseList :EndIf :EndWhile :EndRepeat
:EndFor :EndSelect :EndWith :EndTrap :EndHold :EndDisposable
:GoTo, :Return, :Leave :Continue<p>This approach, its implementation, and its constraints raise a number of
serious problems. To name a few:<ul><li>A rather common APL design practice has it to first debug non-trivial
APL statements in immediate execution mode and only transfer them into
the body of defined functions when they work properly. However, the keywords
above seem to work only in the bodies of defined functions but <b>not</b> in
immediate execution mode. The reason seems to be that their implementation
depends on labels which are not available in immediate execution.<li>Another rather common design practice is to limit the length of
lines to less than 80 characters (e.g. in the GNU coding conventions,
<b>https://gcc.gnu.org/codingconventions.html#Line</b>).
Even if it were possible to squeeze an :If :Then :Else :Endif into an 80
character line, and using a single whitespace around the keywords for
readability, wastes almost 1/3 of the precious 80 characters for keywords.
In this example, each of the COND, THEN, and ELSE parts must then be &lt; 20
characters on average. Not to talk about indentation to clarify the code.<li>Each of the keywords has rather specific constraints as to how and
where it can be used. For example (to quote a simple one from a reference
manual):<p><i>Control words, including qualifiers such as :Else and :ElseIf, may occur
only at the beginning of a line or expression in a diamond-separated
statement. The only exceptions are :In and :InEach which must appear on
the same line within a :For expression.</i><p>These constraints suggest that the keywords mentioned are merely syntactic
sugar that covers the underlying APL structure, i.e. labels and computed
branches. GNU APL does not claim to be fundamentally different in that
regard, but the syntax of the syntactic sugar is somewhat simpler.</ul><p>Learning from the above, the conclusions for the syntax of GNU APL condionals
were these:<ol><li>the syntax shall be easy to understand and consistent,<li>the syntax shall work in immediate execution mode (as long as
the entire conditional is provided on a single input line),<li>to support 2., lengthy keywords shall be avoided in favour of the
original APL style, and<li>the syntax needs to only support those cases where the standard APL
flow control (i.e. →N) becomes cumbersome. There is absolutely no benefit in
introducing a new (and redundant) syntax when the standard APL mechanism
is already completely adequate.</ol><p>As to the last point, almost every flow control case (in a standards compliant
APL program) falls into one of the following categories (sorted by
increasing complexity):<ol><li><b>one-sided if</b>: if COND then THEN endif<li><b>two-sided if/else</b>: if COND then THEN else ELSE endif<li><b>loop</b>: while COND do BODY (or its less frequently used twin do BODY
while COND)<li><b>switch/case</b>: switch ARG case CASE1 case CASE2 case ... CASEn endswitch</ol><p>where THEN, ELSE, CASE1, CASE2, CASEn, and BODY are a sequence of one or more
statements, while COND or ARG control which of these sequences (if any)
shall be executed.<p>Interestingly, the complexity of the above cases, when coded in APL,
increases in amost the reverse order (compared to other languages).
For example,<ol><li><b>switch/case</b>:<pre class=verbatim>    →(ARG) / L1  L2 ...  Ln   ⍝ switch(ARG)
L1: CASE1 ◊ →L_endcase        ⍝ case 1:
L2: CASE2 ◊ →L_endcase        ⍝ case 2:
...
LN: CASEn                     ⍝ case N:
L_endcase:
</pre><li><b>loop</b>:<pre class=verbatim> Loop: BODY ◊ →(COND) / Loop   ⍝ repeat BODY while COND
</pre><li><b>one-sided if</b>:<pre class=verbatim>  →(!COND) / L_endif   ⍝ jump over the THEN clause
  THEN
L_endif:
</pre><p>or, not uncommon and shorter, but less portable and less readable:<pre class=verbatim>  →(!COND) / ↑1+⎕LC ◊ THEN  ⍝ jump over the THEN clause to the next line
</pre><li><b>two-sided if/else</b>:<pre class=verbatim>  →COND ↓ L_else L_then
L_then: THEN ◊ →L_endif
L_else: ELSE
L_endif:
</pre></ol><p>A closer look at these case reveals that there is not much room for
syntax improvements in cases 1. (switch) and 2. (loop). The introduction of
a new syntax like :Select / :Case for switches or :For / :Endfor for loops
would therefore only make matters different and incompatible, but not better.<p>In case 3. (one-sided if) there is also not much to gain. However, case 3.
can be seen as a special case of case 4. (with an empty ELSE clause). As
a matter of consistency, a new syntax for case 4. should also cover case 3.<p>The only cases where a new syntax could improve matters are therefore
cases 3. and 4.<p>Another consideration relates to the end marker <b>L_endif</b> (and would
likewise relate to <b>L_endcase</b> if we hadn’t already ruled that case out).
There are two reasonable syntax alternatives to handle the branch to the
end of the conditional:<ol><li>allow multiple statements in the THEN and ELSE clauses and mark the end
of the <b>ELSE</b> clause (or, in the one-sided case 3 of the <b>THEN</b> clause
with some <b>ENDIF</b> marker, or<li>allow only single statement clauses (which implies the <b>ENDIF</b> and
makes it obsolete.</ol><p>The design decision made in GNU APL was to go for multiple statements because
the advantage in 2. (shorter code) looks much smaller than the advantages
of 1. (e.g. insertion of debug printouts into a clause).</div><div class=subsection id=Syntax-1><h4 class=subsection>2.40.2 Syntax</h4><p>With the above considerations in mind, GNU APL decided for the following
syntax:<ul><li><b>one-sided if/else</b>:<pre class=verbatim>      COND →→ THEN ←←
</pre><li><b>two-sided if/else</b>:<pre class=verbatim>      COND →→ THEN ←→ ELSE ←←
</pre></ul><p>For this syntax to work, the following rules must be followed:<ul><li>The →→, ←→, and ←← markers must be single tokens (2 adjacent Unicode
characters) That is, no whitespace (and in particular no line feed) is
permitted between the first and the second arrow. A single → is a valid
APL statement (named Escape). A linefeed between two → turns the single
token →→ into two valid (though most of the time useless) Escape statements.<li>The →→, ←→, and ←← tokens are <b>end-of statement</b> markers (as opposed
to <b>beginning-of statement</b> markers). Each marker binds to the non-empty
statement left of it. APL is parsed line by line, so there can never be a
valid non-empty APL statement left of the first token of a line. As a
consequence, a →→ token, a ←→ token, or a ←← token at the beginning of
a line is a SYNTAX ERROR.<li>The COND, THEN, and ELSE clauses shall be non-empty (!) sequences of
valid APL statements. In particular:<ul><li>The condition COND shall be a <i>single statement</i> that evaluates to
a 1-item Boolean array (of any rank). The statement result of COND is a
committed value (and therefore not displayed).<li>The THEN clause shall be <i>one or more valid statements</i>, separated
by ◊ for more than one statement.<li>The ELSE clause (if present) shall be <i>one or more valid statements</i>,
separated by ◊ for more than one statement.</ul></ul><p>Examples:<pre class=verbatim>      ⍝ short format. Valid in immediate execution and in defined functions

the result will be an APL integer. If the result is too large for a 64-bit
signed integer then the result will be automatically converted to an APL
floating point value. However, if the result is outside the guaranteed range
but still within the 64-bit integer range, e.g. between 9200000000000000000
and 9223372036854775807 (exclusive), then GNU APL gives no guarantees as to
whether the result will be a 64-bit integer or a 64-bit floating point (with
the resulting loss of precision). This decision is usually function-specific
and driven by performance considerations.<p>APL values have a maximum rank of 8. However, the maximum range can be set
by means of ./configure (see README-2-configure).</div><div class=section id=Shared-Variables><h3 class=section>3.2 Shared Variables</h3><p>The system functions and variables related to shared variables, i.e. ⎕SVO, ⎕SVR,
⎕SVC, ⎕SVS, and ⎕SVQ, are implemented.<p>Communication between two workspaces is supported, but with some
limitations. Two workspaces can only communicate via shared variables if they
(i.e. their processes) run on the same machine.<p>However, only two auxiliary processors, AP100 and AP210, are provided as
examples of how to implement auxiliary processors in GNU APL.<p>Shared variables for auxiliary processors are provided for some backward
compatibility. In the past - without access to the source code of the APL
interpreter - shared variables were the only method available to extend the
functionality of the interpreter.<p>With this interpreter - and access to its source code - it is often more
convenient to add your own commands or your own system variables to the
APL interpreter rather than adding auxiliary processors.<hr></div></div><div class=chapter id=Chapter-4><div class=header><p>Next: <a href=#Chapter-5 accesskey=n rel=next>Project Structure</a>, Previous: <a href=#Chapter-3 accesskey=p rel=prev>Limitations and Missing Features</a>, Up: <a href=#Top accesskey=u rel=up>GNU APL</a> &nbsp; [<a href=#SEC_Contents title="Table of contents" rel=contents>Contents</a>]</div><span id=Internationalization></span><h2 class=chapter>4 Internationalization</h2><p>GNU APL used to be internationalized by means of GNU gettext, but is not
anymore.<p>For APL characters to work properly with keyboards and terminal emulators
(see also README-3-keyboard) it is essential that your LANG environment
variable is correctly set. For German, that would be "de_DE.utf8", like:<p>$export LANG=de_DE.utf8<p>A misspelling of the language can cause APL characters to become unavailable,
even if your xmodmap is correct. You can check your setting by executing the
program ’locale’. If it shows warnings like these:<pre class=verbatim>locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
</pre><p>then something is wrong and you should check your LANG setting and installed
locales.<p>As far as xterm is concerned, the xterm command line options –u8, –lc, and

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div><ol start=0><li>PREAMBLE<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.<li>VERBATIM COPYING<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.<li>MODIFICATIONS<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:<ol type=A start=1><li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</ol><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.<li>TRANSLATION<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.<li>TERMINATION<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
<a href=http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.<li>RELICENSING<p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</ol><span id=ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents></span><h3 class=heading>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of

Version 3, 29 June 2007<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<p>Preamble<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS<p>0. Definitions.<p>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<p>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.<p>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<p>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<p>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.<p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<p>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<p>1. Source Code.<p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.<p>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.<p>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<p>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.<p>2. Basic Permissions.<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.<p>3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.<p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.<p>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
"keep intact all notices".<p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.<p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:<p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.<p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.<p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.<p>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.<p>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.<p>7. Additional Terms.<p>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or<p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or<p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.<p>8. Termination.<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.<p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<p>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<p>11. Patents.<p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s "contributor version".<p>A contributor’s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<p>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.<p>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<p>12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<p>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.<p>14. Revised Versions of this License.<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.<p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<p>16. Limitation of Liability.<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.<p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<p>&lt;one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) &lt;year> &lt;name of author><p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<p>&lt;program> Copyright (C) &lt;year> &lt;name of author>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.<p>The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read
