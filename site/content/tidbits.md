To try can be cringe

but what is truly cringe is

to not try at all.

We are the faceless, the raceless, the nationless, the faithless. All alike,
bound not by blood, but spirit.

One function to map $ them all,

One function to filter them,

One function to reduce $ them all,

And Monad m => >>= m them.

## That Barn

We had gone on a trip, to see the horses.
{{< br >}}
The man showed us this one, named it a fine mare.
{{< br >}}
Was brown... or maybe white with spots?
{{< br >}}
To tell the truth, I wasn't seeing no horse.
{{< br >}}
I was looking. My body was there, at that barn.

But my soul - my soul was far, far away, in a world like no other.
{{< br >}}
Dark - so, so dark. The shadows reached out as if to take me hostage.
{{< br >}}
Out sprawled endless sidewalks, lit by the yellow of aged street lights.
{{< br >}}
I walked - I walked, and I walked. The buzzing filled my mind.
{{< br >}}
Felt as cold as the concrete roads. Thoughts like static.

And then, I was home. My brother, lanky like a statue, was watching the TV.
{{< br >}}
"How was them horses?," he asked, but he wasn't talking to no one.
{{< br >}}
"Wasn't nothing too special," as I fled to my room. He murmed something I didn't catch.
{{< br >}}
And to my bed I went, to wake up from this dream.

I want to fall

infinitely far

onto a bed of stars.
