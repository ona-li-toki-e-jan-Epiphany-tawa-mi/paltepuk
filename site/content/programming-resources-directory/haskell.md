Haskell homepage.

## Hoogle - [https://hoogle.haskell.org *(November 21, 2024)*](https://hoogle.haskell.org/)

Hoogle is *THE GOAT* when it comes to Haskell. It is a search engine that can
find functions matching a paticular name or function signature. One very common
problem in Haskell is how to get from type A to type B, so it is a god-tier
resource.

## HLint - [https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint *(November 21, 2024)*](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint)

HLint is a program that lints your Haskell code. It looks for improvements and
simplifications that you could do.

The main benefit of HLint, in my opinion, is that it will help teach Haskell,
but you will need to exercise some critical thinking in reading it's output.
