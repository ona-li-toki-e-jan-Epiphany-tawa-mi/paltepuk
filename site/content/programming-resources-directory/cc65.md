## cc65 Function Reference - [https://cc65.github.io/doc/funcref.html *(November 15, 2024)*](https://cc65.github.io/doc/funcref.html)

A quick-reference for all of the functions made available with cc65. Also make
sure to check the include files inside the cc65 installation directory (usually
**/usr/share/cc65/include/**,) there's a lot of useful information there.

## cc65 Users Guide - [https://cc65.github.io/doc/cc65.html *(November 15, 2024)*](https://cc65.github.io/doc/cc65.html)

cc65 C compiler documentation. This has a lot of useful information about things
like the inline assembler, computed gotos, and other juicy extensions you might
need.

## cc65 Advanced Optimizations - [https://github.com/ilmenit/CC65-Advanced-Optimizations *(November 15, 2024)*](https://github.com/ilmenit/CC65-Advanced-Optimizations)

A very detailed article about how to write optimized C code with cc65. The cc65
compiler isn't as "smart" as your usual C compilers, and there are a number of
gotchas with the 6502 being an 8-bit processor, so you'll need to change the way
you go about writing C to properly make use of the comparatively-limited
computational resources of the 1980s.
