## PGP Key

You can get my PGP key here:

[/pgp.txt](/pgp.txt)

Don't worry, this is ***NOT*** the one ProtonMail generated.

If you wish to be careful, you can cross-reference my PGP key at the following
site(s):

- GitHub - [https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/paltepuk/blob/master/site/static/pgp.txt](https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/paltepuk/blob/master/site/static/pgp.txt)

... and the signature at the following site(s):

- keys.openpgp.org - [https://keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) | [http://zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion](http://zkaan2xfbuxia2wpf7ofnkbz6r5zdbbvxbunvp5g2iebopbfc4iqmbad.onion)


## Email ![](/web-buttons/email.gif)

You can send me email at the following address:

ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi(at)protonmail(dot)com

Please use my PGP key to encrypt your mail (and make sure to send me yours!)

## Guestbook

You can use my guestbook [/guestbook](/guestbook) to send me messages.

The guestbook submissions are saved to a file for me to read and approve at a
later time. If you don't want it posted to the guestbook, just put something
like **"DO NOT POST TO GUESTBOOK"** in your message.

WARNING: If it's something sensitive, either don't send it over the Clearnet, or
do so after encrypting it with my PGP key, since CloudFlare will be able to read
(and possibly modify) it!
