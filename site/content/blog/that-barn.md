## That Barn

We had gone on a trip, to see the horses.
{{< br >}}
The man showed us this one, named it a fine mare.
{{< br >}}
Was brown... or maybe white with spots?
{{< br >}}
To tell the truth, I wasn't seeing no horse.
{{< br >}}
I was looking. My body was there, at that barn.

But my soul - my soul was far, far away, in a world like no other.
{{< br >}}
Dark - so, so dark. The shadows reached out as if to take me hostage.
{{< br >}}
Out sprawled endless sidewalks, lit by the yellow of aged street lights.
{{< br >}}
I walked - I walked, and I walked. The buzzing filled my mind.
{{< br >}}
Felt as cold as the concrete roads. Thoughts like static.

And then, I was home. My brother, lanky like a statue, was watching the TV.
{{< br >}}
"How was them horses?," he asked, but he wasn't talking to no one.
{{< br >}}
"Wasn't nothing too special," as I fled to my room. He murmed something I didn't catch.
{{< br >}}
And to my bed I went, to wake up from this dream.
