"Honestly, that's what I call a cool story bro. Such a riveting tale, I honestly
copy and pasted it to word, saved on my hard drive, backed it up on a jump
drive, drove to the bank, put the jump drive in the safe deposit box, and will
leave it there until my kids turn about 12 (when they can actually state their
age, and ask what it is I'm showing them), when I will pick it up, put it in an
old USB drive reader and relay this cool story to them and tell them, 'kids,
this is what a cool story should look and sound like... not like the stories
your generation tells.'"
