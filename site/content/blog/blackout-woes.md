Hello everyone! If you noticed that paltepuk was down for a few days, that's
because there was a blackout! A massive ice storm rolled in that split apart
trees, snapped powerlines, blew out transformers, etc..

The area nearby is covered in downed trees, but luckily the damage to buildings
seems to be minor, at least where I live anyways. One (large part of a) tree
actually fell in my yard! Luckily the tree line is pretty far from the house, so
that's not much of a worry, but it did almost crush my shed:

Some of the branches ended up impaling themselves into the dirt; I found a big
one that went a foot into the ground! There's also a mound of dirt that got
kicked up where the biggest part of it hit:

I picked up and broke down most of what I could by hand, and I'll take a
chainsaw to it later and make it into firewood and a splitting stump.

I'm glad I set up my servers on an UPS. Of course, without internet, the website
can't run anyways, but it does let me power them off safely, and the UPS can act
as an emergency battery with it's leftover power.
