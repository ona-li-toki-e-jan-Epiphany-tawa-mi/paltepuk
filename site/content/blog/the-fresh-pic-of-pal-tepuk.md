Written: January 22, 2025.

I've been feeling that I have grown out of my current profile picture/logo. Here
it is for reference:

![Old logo](/blog/the-fresh-pic-of-pal-tepuk/old-pic.webp)

This image is a heavily distorted version of some shitty drawing of Byakuren Hijiri
[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Byakuren_Hijiri *(January 22, 2025)*](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Byakuren_Hijiri)
that I made in GIMP. She's character from the Touhou Project (music, bullet hell
games, some other stuff,) and is a Buddhist nun with demon magic, magic muscles,
and a motorcycle. Overall badass character.

I was planning to also model my new logo after her, but I couldn't come up with
any ideas I was satisfied with.

I decided to just make a list of things I like that might make for a decent
logo:

- Witches.
- Cyborgs.
- Penguins.
- Eyes.
- Eldtritch things.
- Computers.
- My favorite colors: black, purple, hot pink, and greenyellow.
- Byakuren Hijiri.
- Ayano Tateyama - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagerou_Project#Ayano *(January 22, 2025)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagerou_Project#Ayano)
- Dragons.

I was using GIMP, but I have trouble getting out my ideas with digital tools
unless it's low resolution pixel art for stuff like Luanti
[https://www.luanti.org *(January 22, 2025)*](https://www.luanti.org/)
or M*necraft.

I much prefer the world of the mechanical pencil and paper, and hashed out this
draft after much deliberation:

You'll have to excuse the photo quality a bit, my camera's glass cover is busted
to pieces and filled with dust.

Originally I was gonna go with Byakuren, but then I felt like some kind of
penguin would be a better approach.

One of the artworks for chapter 28 of the Witch Hat Atelier manga (highly
recommend btw)
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_Hat_Atelier *(January 22, 2025)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_Hat_Atelier),
has two of the main character Coco, the left in a Pointed Caps (the "good" gyus)
outfit, and the right in a Brimmed Caps (the "bad" guys) outift. The Brimmed
Cap's hat is super, super, super cool, check it out:

Wow! So, I tried to create some kind of witchy hat for the penguin. Instead of
the weird jewelery thing at the middle of the hat, I put some eye-like
decoration and a band of diagonal lines below it.

I liked the hat, but not the penguin, so I went with trying to make something
more humanoid. I gave it a turtle neck shirt with a darker dress over top.

I slapped some extra eyes on it for good measure. I've got a raging art boner
for things with absurd amounts of eyes. It does remind me of Allmother-sama from
Parallel Paradise
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Paradise *(January 22, 2025)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Paradise)
a bit, and I'm not too sure what to think of that:

I thought about using this picture as the logo, but then I had a ***divine
intellect*** and tried to trace over the image in GIMP. After adding some color
to it, it turned out pretty cool:

I quite like the way this looks, and it was easy, so I think I'll use this
technique in the future.

Then I added in the eye motif on the hat, but replaced the band of diagonal
lines with a criss-cross pattern. I also added the tassels, but in white.

I also slapped a bunch of eyes on the face, giving them different colors and
pupils, resulting in this final image:

*Mwah!*

I like both the simple and more detailed versions, so I decided to keep them
both.

I'm also thinking of giving my web button a redesign while I'm at it.
