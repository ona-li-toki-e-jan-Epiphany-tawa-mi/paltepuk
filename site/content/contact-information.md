## Email ![](/web-buttons/email.gif)

You can send me email at the following address:

ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi(at)protonmail(dot)com

Please use my PGP key to encrypt your mail (and make sure to send me yours!):

[/pgp.asc](/pgp.asc)

Don't worry, this is ***NOT*** the one ProtonMail generated.

## Guestbook

You can use my guestbook [/guestbook](/guestbook) to send me messages.

The guestbook submissions are saved to a file for me to read and approve at a
later time. If you don't want it posted to the guestbook, just put something
like **"DO NOT POST TO GUESTBOOK"** in your message.

If it's something sensitive, you might not want to send it over the Clearnet,
since CloudFlare will be able to read it. Consider submitting it over Tor or I2P
instead.
