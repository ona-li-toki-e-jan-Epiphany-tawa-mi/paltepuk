- I2P - [http://nytzrhrjjfsutowojvxi7hphesskpqqr65wpistz6wa7cpajhp7a.b32.i2p *(February 1, 2025)*](http://nytzrhrjjfsutowojvxi7hphesskpqqr65wpistz6wa7cpajhp7a.b32.i2p)

An index site for the I2P network. I like this one more than the other indexes
because it shows information about the site like: the kind of content it has,
how responsive it is, what language it's in, etc..

They also have a blog where they talk about and rate various eepsites. They even reviewed my site

Thank you not_bob, very cool.
