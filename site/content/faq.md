## Why do the links have dates?

Links to the outside internet that I do not control, and even the ones I do
control, are liable to change. I place dates on the links I don't have control
over, stating the day I added or reviewed the link. Please keep this date in
mind when viewing the content each link points to.

## YOUR SITE LINKS TO ABUSIVE/ILLEGAL CONTENT!!! WHAT DO?!?!

I make sure that the links I add to the website do not contain such content at
the time of adding them (see above question,) however, other peoples' websites
are completely outside of my control, and thus the content pointed to may
change at any time without my awareness.

If you find that one of the links here points to abusive/illegal content, please
either contact me directly [/contact-information/](/contact-information/), or
make an issue on GitHub
[https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/paltepuk/issues](https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/paltepuk/issues),
and I'll take it off after reviewing that this is indeed the case.
