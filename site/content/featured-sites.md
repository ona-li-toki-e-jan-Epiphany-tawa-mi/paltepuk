### Penger City - [https://penger.city *(November 16, 2024)*](https://penger.city)

Penger.

### [![](/buttons/landchad.net.gif)](https://landchad.net) LandChad.net - [https://landchad.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://landchad.net)

A site that teaches people how to make their own website, and run their own
services, on a server all of their own.

Learn to make your own website ***NOW!*** Stop being a social media serf!

### Yusynth - [https://yusynth.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://yusynth.net)

A badass website about DIY audio synthesizers.

### [![](/buttons/based.cooking.gif)](https://based.cooking) Based Cooking - [https://based.cooking *(November 16, 2024)*](https://based.cooking)

Cooking recipe site that isn't bloated with ads and pointless
JavaScript.

Unfortuantely, it seems that the PRs with new recipes aren't being merged, but
there's still a pretty sizeable amount of recipes on there. Maybe the unaboomer
decided to cut the cord again.

### [![](/buttons/wiby.me.gif)](https://wiby.me) Wiby - [https://wiby.me *(November 16, 2024)*](https://wiby.me) | [https://wiby.org *(November 16, 2024)*](https://wiby.org)

Cool search engine for proper websites (simple and not overloaded with JavaScript.)

### jgeoff.com/homepage - [http://jgeoff.com/homepage *(November 16, 2024)*](http://jgeoff.com/homepage/)

God tier site. Nice car. Love the hate emails at the bottom of the page.

### Nathan's Toasty Technology page - [http://toastytech.com *(November 16, 2024)*](http://toastytech.com)

Really cool personal website. Highly recommend checking the page on Internet
Explorer.

### SupertTuxKart - [https://supertuxkart.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://supertuxkart.net)

The website for SuperTuxKart, a free as-in freedom racing game. It's one of my
favorite games. If you havent tried it yet, you should! It's probably available
in your package manager.

### [![](/buttons/cozynet.org.gif)](https://cozynet.org/homepage/) CozyNet - [https://cozynet.org/homepage *(November 16, 2024)*](https://cozynet.org/homepage) | [http://kfgw55ndxkdnxu42cntbm3fd7tthrxgruq4bewaxhc7iytysetmreuyd.onion/homepage *(November 16, 2024)*](http://kfgw55ndxkdnxu42cntbm3fd7tthrxgruq4bewaxhc7iytysetmreuyd.onion/homepage/)

Some rando's personal website that feels cozy. Love the style.

### 512KB Club - [https://512kb.club *(November 16, 2024)*](https://512kb.club)

A showcase of websites with an uncompressed size of <= 512 KB.

### dnscheck.tools - [https://www.dnscheck.tools *(November 16, 2024)*](https://www.dnscheck.tools/)

*Note: requires JavaScript.*

A DNS tool that shows which DNS severs you're using and whether you're using
DNSSEC. I've found it rather useful.

### The XTerm Window Manager - [https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io *(November 16, 2024)*](https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io)

A console window manager. Really cool.

### [![](/buttons/gorescript.github.io.gif)](https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play) Gorescript classic - [https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play *(November 16, 2024)*](https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play)

*Note: requires JavaScript and WebGL.*

Cool 2.5D first person shooter. The creator abandoned this "classic" version and
started selling a new version on Steam, but the classic version is still online,
and it's open source!
