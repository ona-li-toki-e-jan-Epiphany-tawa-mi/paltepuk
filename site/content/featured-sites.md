### Consumer Action Taskforce - [https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com *(January 20, 2025)*](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com)

A wiki/database started by the GOAT Louis Rossman to fight back against
companies trying to fuck over their customers.

This wiki seeks to document when companies do things like making subscriptions
difficult to cancel, making electronic devices depend on the cloud,
retroactively changing their Terms of Service, etc., to help protect our
consumer rights.

Cooking recipe site that isn't bloated with ads and pointless
JavaScript.

Unfortuantely, it seems that the PRs with new recipes aren't being merged, but
there's still a pretty sizeable amount of recipes on there. Maybe the unaboomer
decided to cut the cord again.

A DNS tool that shows which DNS severs you're using and whether you're using
DNSSEC. I've found it rather useful.

### SuperTuxKart - [https://supertuxkart.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://supertuxkart.net)

The website for SuperTuxKart, a free as-in freedom racing game. It's one of my
favorite games. If you havent tried it yet, you should! It's probably available
in your package manager.

### The XTerm Window Manager - [https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io *(November 16, 2024)*](https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io)

God tier site. If we lived in a sane world, this is how the internet would be.

Nice car.

I really love the hate emails at the bottom of the page, adds a lot of
character.

*Warning(s): requires JavaScript and WebGL.*

Cool 2.5D first person shooter. The creator abandoned this "classic" version and
started selling a new version on Steam, but the classic version is still online,
and it's open source!

### Nathan's Toasty Technology page - [http://toastytech.com *(January 30, 2025)*](http://toastytech.com)

A website that looks straight out of the 2000s.

There's a cool section/blog on different GUIs, both old and new. And, when I say
old, I mean dating back to the 1980s.

They host a number of DOOM WADs they made themselves.

They really, really, really like Mozilla Firefox. There's even a DOOM WAD themed
after it:

guestbook, etc..

It has a cute aesthetic. The use of web buttons is very epic.

Their website has a bunch of mirrors, and they have access over gopher and
gemini, which is pretty cool.

They have some software projects they wrote and host.

They have a blog, and host a number of services, i.e.: IRC, Mumble, file upload,
... and a web ring! Their website is also a part of a number of other web rings.

Their website has a JavaScript detector and displays "Javascript is
disabled. Keep it up" if it's disabled, which is pretty baller.

![](/web-buttons/luvstarkei.com.webp) LuvstarKei - [https://luvstarkei.com *(Updated January 30, 2025)*](https://luvstarkei.com)

*Warning(s): WordPress site, extremly bloated.*

Extremely cute website. The use of web buttons is very epic.

They are a graphic designer. Their website is covered with a wide variety of
images, giving a very deco vibe.

There's a ton of art on it. They have their own universe-kinda thing called the
Astraverse that a lot of their art relates to. It's pretty cool.

They have a couple blogs for different topics. There's one about their art, one
about M*necraft, a sketchbook, etc..

I'm sure you can expect what kind of content this website has. Just ingore the
Monero address. Or don't, I'm not your mom.
