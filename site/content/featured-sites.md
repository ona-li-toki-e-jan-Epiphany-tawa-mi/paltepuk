A rather simple, but nice looking website. The use of web buttons is very
epic. Their site is part of a couple web rings.

They have a blog, though it's a bit empty. The content is tech related.

They do some photography, and have posted some nice pictures on the photography
page.

They have a neat "song of the day" thing on the sidebar.

They have a page about their servers and some services they host, the main
accessible thing being their IRC server.

*Warning(s): French ;).*

- [https://rgbteahouse.neocities.org *(February 25, 2025)*](https://rgbteahouse.neocities.org)

A website that harkens back to the web of yore. It's loaded with a bunch of cute
and silly GIFs. The use of web buttons is very epic.

They have a marquee! on the main page that displays random and cute "news."

The site is a mish-mash of a couple languages. Mainly English and French it
seems.

There's *a lot* of art under the gallery page.

They also have a diary page covering completely random topics like trees, bugs,
art, photography, etc..

### ![](/web-buttons/baccyflap.com.webp) baccyflap.com

*Warning(s): PHP, extremely classy.*

- [https://baccyflap.com *(February 25, 2025)*](https://baccyflap.com)

A site named after the mighty baccyflap
[https://baccyflap.com/mus/baccyflap *(February 25, 2025)*](https://baccyflap.com/mus/baccyflap/).

The museum page is a blog-of-sorts that covers a wide variety of topics, all
which I highly recommend reading.

The personal page is another blog. It also covers a variety of topies, and I
also highly recommend reading them.

There's all sorts of random quirks and cool secrets hidden around. Make sure to
explore!

They've got a guestbook, and it's open source
[https://baccyflap.com/res/gbdl *(February 25, 2025)*](https://baccyflap.com/res/gbdl/)!

Their website is part of quite a few webrings, and they also host a webring
specifically for websites without AI (see [#webrings](#webrings).)

### ![](/web-buttons/hotlinecafe.com.gif) ![](/web-buttons/hotlinecafe.com-2.gif) ![](/web-buttons/hotlinecafe.com-old2.gif) Fionn's Hotline Cafe

- [https://hotlinecafe.com *(February 5, 2025)*](https://hotlinecafe.com)

Their site has an intense vaporwave aesthetic. The use of web buttons is very
epic.

The random pointless Japanese is very cute; 貴方も愛してるぞー。

They made a game?!?! called Total Anarchy
[https://fionnhodgson.itch.io/totalanarchy *(February 5, 2025)*](https://fionnhodgson.itch.io/totalanarchy).
It's a top-down shooter open-world crime game. It's proprietary and for W*ndows
only, though they do have a free demo.

They host some songs they made, and they're shared under CC BY-SA 3.0. Very
epic! They're "casiocore-meets-vapourhouse" as described by the web
master. There's also some MIDI stuff with some *fun facts.*

They have a variety of browser games (which require Javascript and WebGL) and
Game Maker games in the arcade section.

They've got some kind of photo album. The site goes grayscale when you open this
section. There's some cool SSTV-distorted (Slow Scan Television) images.

They've got a bunch of artwork in a vareity of mediums, like drawings, 3D images
and animations, some cool album cover art, etc..

They made a cool "museum" of a bunch of old electronics they have/had. The
typewriters are the coolest part in my opinion.

### ![](/web-buttons/blog.shr4pnel.com.gif) shrapnelnet

- [https://blog.shr4pnel.com *(February 1, 2025)*](https://blog.shr4pnel.com)

Their site has a cute frog wallpaper-esque background. The use of web buttons is
very epic. Their website is a part of a bunch of web rings.

Their website consists mainly of a blog, covering topics like developing and
maintaining their website, Linux, music and musicians, art and artists,
etc.. The posts are detailed and a very good read.

Their website is FOSS
[https://git.shr4pnel.com/observer/blog *(February 1, 2025)*](https://git.shr4pnel.com/observer/blog).
Super cool.

Their website has a JavaScript detector and displays "no javascript? awesome!"
if it's disabled.

### Float Overblow

*Warning(s): contains AI-generated content.*

- [https://floatoverblow.com *(February 1, 2025)*](https://floatoverblow.com)

The homepage is a little sus.

They have a blog, but there's only three posts as of February 1, 2025. Two are
about AI and the other is about their dog.

They host quite a few songs they made. Some of them are pretty interesting, and
some of them are really, really weird. There's also some AI generated stuff.

I really liked the following songs:

- 3xOsc Invasion.
- bluster.
- EVERYTHING IS ORANGE.
- sec.
- prunk.

### Gabe Rocks!

A rather simple looking website. The use of web buttons is very epic. Their site
is part of a couple web rings.

Their website primarily consists of three blogs:

Technology - a blog about various technologies. It has a paticular focus on
digital sovereignty - having control over our technology and digital lives. I
highly recommend reading the article "Reclaiming Territory in Cyberspace."

Thoughts - various thoughts and ramblings.

Health - the meat and potatoes of their website, in my opinion, where they
describe, in excruciating detail, their experiences with obesity, how they got
there, and their long and ongoing journey to a healthy weight.

### strangedefinition.com

*Warning(s): PHP, contains AI-generated content.*

- [https://strangedefinition.com *(February 1, 2025)*](https://strangedefinition.com)

A weird personal website/blog. The posts are about art they made themselves, AI
generated art, poetry, short stories, dreams, art tutorials, etc..

They have made and published a couple drawing books
[https://strangedefinition.com/index.php/books *(February 1, 2025)*](https://strangedefinition.com/index.php/books/).

A blog with topics ranging from philosophical meanderings to deranged
shitposts. A mildly amusing read.

From the words of the web master: "Whenever you are reading one of my articles
keep in mind that I live under a rock and might be completely delusional."

They have Gemini access.

### ![](/web-buttons/kor.i2p.webp) kor.i2p

- [http://korafble2jftgvagce4v5zuxegsqprl3xqvpi373bhnjdzj62joa.b32.i2p *(January 30, 2025)*](http://korafble2jftgvagce4v5zuxegsqprl3xqvpi373bhnjdzj62joa.b32.i2p)

Their website's home page has an image of Tux towering over some office
buildings, saying "Good evening Mr. Gates, I'll be your server today!,"
Incredibly cute.

The use of web buttons is very epic.

They have a blog/wiki-sorta thing that covers a WIIIIDDDEE variety of topics
like games and consoles (i.e.: Team Fortresss 2, Touhou, Xbox 360,) Linux,
networking, VTubers, Vocaloid, imageboards, Sailor Moon, Gamergate?!?, etc..

There's a couple programming books they host a digital copy of.

They have host a number of videos, and a website archive with a couple websites,
which relate to the topics they blog/wiki(?) about.

There's an archive for a bunch of Flash games/other. It seems that you need to
enable JavaScript to play them.

I like their philosophy to their website's design, which they *mainly* specify
as (there's more on the Web Design Philosophy page):

- Simple.
- Not too distracting.
- Personal - I should express myself but not too much to the detriment of the visitor.
- Easy to read.

They have a pretty cool blog. The posts are incredibly detailed and cover a wide
variety of tech-related topics like home automation, systems administration,
working on cars, Linux, networking, etc., and also some non-technical topics
like their dogs.

One of the goals of their website is to serve as documentation for
troubleshooting and solving various issues, which many of the blog posts double
as.

They also host a number of videos they made, but it seems you need to enable
JavaScript to view them.

### ![](/web-buttons/luvstarkei.com.webp) LuvstarKei

*Warning(s): extremely bloated.*

- [https://luvstarkei.com *(January 30, 2025)*](https://luvstarkei.com)

You will need to enable JavaScript to view some of the content, but it will work
without.

Extremely cute website. The use of web buttons is very epic.

Their website is covered with a wide variety of images, giving a very deco vibe.

There's a ton of art on it. They have their own universe-kinda thing called the
Astraverse that a lot of their art relates to.

They have a couple blogs for different topics. There's one about their art, one
about M*necraft, a sketchbook, etc..

### ![](/web-buttons/getimiskon.xyz.webp) getimiskon's space

It has a cute aesthetic. The use of web buttons is very epic.

Their website has a bunch of mirrors, and they have access over Gopher and
Gemini.

They have some software projects they wrote and host.

They have a blog, and host a number of services, i.e.: IRC, Mumble, file upload,
... and a web ring! Their website is also a part of a number of other web rings.

Their website has a JavaScript detector and displays "Javascript is
disabled. Keep it up" if it's disabled.

A website that has a very cozy style. Lots of Pepe.

They have a blog, IRC server, forum (no posts on it, though,) music, videos,
guestbook, etc..

### Nathan's Toasty Technology page

- [http://toastytech.com *(January 30, 2025)*](http://toastytech.com)

A website that looks straight out of the 2000s.

There's a cool section/blog on different GUIs, both old and new. And, when I say
old, I mean dating back to the 1980s.

They host a number of DOOM WADs they made themselves.

They really, really, really like Mozilla Firefox. There's even a DOOM WAD themed
after it:
[https://toastytech.com/good/ffdoom.html *(January 30, 2025)*](https://toastytech.com/good/ffdoom.html)

Highly recommend checking the page on Internet Explorer.

### Yusynth

there's still a pretty sizeable amount of recipes on there. Maybe the unaboomer
decided to cut the cord again.
