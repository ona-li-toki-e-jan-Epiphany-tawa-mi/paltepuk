companies trying to fuck over their customers.

This wiki seeks to document when companies do things like making subscriptions

retroactively changing their Terms of Service, etc., to help protect our
consumer rights.

Cooking recipe site that isn't bloated with ads and pointless
JavaScript.

Unfortuantely, it seems that the PRs with new recipes aren't being merged, but
there's still a pretty sizeable amount of recipes on there. Maybe the unaboomer
decided to cut the cord again.

The website for SuperTuxKart, a free as-in freedom racing game. It's one of my
favorite games. If you havent tried it yet, you should! It's probably available
in your package manager.

*Requires JavaScript.*

A DNS tool that shows which DNS severs you're using and whether you're using
DNSSEC. I've found it rather useful.

A console window manager. Really cool.

Cool 2.5D first person shooter. The creator abandoned this "classic" version and

I'm sure you can expect what kind of content this website has. Just ingore the
Monero address. Or don't, I'm not your mom.
