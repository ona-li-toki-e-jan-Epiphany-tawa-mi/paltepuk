### Yusynth - [https://yusynth.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://yusynth.net)

A badass website about DIY audio synthesizers.

### Nathan's Toasty Technology page - [http://toastytech.com *(January 30, 2025)*](http://toastytech.com)

A website that looks straight out of the 2000s.

There's a cool section/blog on different GUIs, both old and new. And, when I say
old, I mean dating back to the 1980s.

They host a number of DOOM WADs they made themselves.

They really, really, really like Mozilla Firefox. There's even a DOOM WAD themed
after it:
[https://toastytech.com/good/ffdoom.html *(January 30, 2025)*](https://toastytech.com/good/ffdoom.html)

Highly recommend checking the page on Internet Explorer.

### ![](/web-buttons/cozynet.org.gif) CozyNet - [https://cozynet.org/homepage *(January 30, 2025)*](https://cozynet.org/homepage) | [http://kfgw55ndxkdnxu42cntbm3fd7tthrxgruq4bewaxhc7iytysetmreuyd.onion/homepage *(January 30, 2025)*](http://kfgw55ndxkdnxu42cntbm3fd7tthrxgruq4bewaxhc7iytysetmreuyd.onion/homepage)

A website that has a very cozy style. Lots of Pepe.

They have a blog, IRC server, forum (no posts on it, though,) music, videos,
guestbook, etc..

### ![](/web-buttons/getimiskon.xyz.webp) getimiskon's space - [https://getimiskon.xyz *(January 30, 2025)*](https://getimiskon.xyz) | [http://r53zi7kxyqd72fuvhztzi25fo2bze7fqjefze7k6t6kiq74pzaq5suyd.onion *(January 30, 2025)*](http://r53zi7kxyqd72fuvhztzi25fo2bze7fqjefze7k6t6kiq74pzaq5suyd.onion) | [http://s5jiovqhpzbjqqibtd5ophlpnmcgenlmbvevzfq2hj5iepwix3aq.b32.i2p *(January 30, 2025)*](http://s5jiovqhpzbjqqibtd5ophlpnmcgenlmbvevzfq2hj5iepwix3aq.b32.i2p)

It has a cute aesthetic. The use of web buttons is very epic.

Their website has a bunch of mirrors, and they have access over Gopher and
Gemini, which is pretty cool.

They have some software projects they wrote and host.

They have a blog, and host a number of services, i.e.: IRC, Mumble, file upload,
... and a web ring! Their website is also a part of a number of other web rings.

Their website has a JavaScript detector and displays "Javascript is
disabled. Keep it up" if it's disabled, which is pretty baller.

### ![](/web-buttons/luvstarkei.com.webp) LuvstarKei - [https://luvstarkei.com *(January 30, 2025)*](https://luvstarkei.com)

*Warning(s): WordPress site, extremly bloated.*

You will need to enable JavaScript to view some of the content, but it will work
without.

Extremely cute website. The use of web buttons is very epic.

Their website is covered with a wide variety of images, giving a very deco vibe.

There's a ton of art on it. They have their own universe-kinda thing called the
Astraverse that a lot of their art relates to. It's pretty cool.

They have a couple blogs for different topics. There's one about their art, one
about M*necraft, a sketchbook, etc..

### `www.bentasker.co.uk` - [www.bentasker.co.uk *(January 30, 2025)*](www.bentasker.co.uk) | [http://gdncgijky3xvocpkq6xqk5uda4vsnvzuk7ke7jrvxnvyjwkq35iq.b32.i2p *(January 30, 2025)*](http://gdncgijky3xvocpkq6xqk5uda4vsnvzuk7ke7jrvxnvyjwkq35iq.b32.i2p) | [http://e26whn2524322mkxb3cbyk27ev2ihhq2biz35hty7gzgsyrwrygq27yd.onion *(January 30, 2025)*](http://e26whn2524322mkxb3cbyk27ev2ihhq2biz35hty7gzgsyrwrygq27yd.onion)

They have a pretty cool blog. The posts are incredibly detailed and cover a wide
variety of tech-related topics like home automation, systems administration,
working on cars, Linux, networking, etc., and also some non-technical topics
like their dogs.

One of the goals of their website is to serve as documentation for
troubleshooting and solving various issues, which many of the blog posts double
as.

They also host a number of videos they made, but it seems you need to enable
JavaScript to view them.

### kor.i2p - [http://korafble2jftgvagce4v5zuxegsqprl3xqvpi373bhnjdzj62joa.b32.i2p *(January 30, 2025)*](http://korafble2jftgvagce4v5zuxegsqprl3xqvpi373bhnjdzj62joa.b32.i2p)

Their website's home page has an image of Tux towering over some office
buildings, saying "Good evening Mr. Gates, I'll be your server today!," which is
incredibly cute.

The use of web buttons is very epic.

They have a blog/wiki-sorta thing that covers a WIIIIDDDEE variety of topics
like games and consoles (i.e.: Team Fortresss 2, Touhou, Xbox 360,) Linux,
networking, VTubers, Vocaloid, imageboards, Sailor Moon, Gamergate?!?, etc..

There's a couple programming books they host a digital copy of.

They have host a number of videos, and a website archive with a couple websites,
which relate to the topics they blog/wiki(?) about.

There's an archive for a bunch of Flash games/other. It seems that you need to
enable JavaScript to play them.

I like their philosophy to their website's design, which they *mainly* specify
as (there's more on the Web Design Philosophy page):

- Simple.
- Not too distracting.
- Personal - I should express myself but not too much to the detriment of the visitor.
- Easy to read.

### ![](/web-buttons/deurachavich.moe.webp) Deurachavich's personal site - [https://deurachavich.moe *(January 30, 2025)*](https://deurachavich.moe) | [http://muzbw3zyg2mxnrqtals2jp43z6l6hzlxsjyaflkzjlhpumjrvcjjpiid.onion *(January 30, 2025)*](http://muzbw3zyg2mxnrqtals2jp43z6l6hzlxsjyaflkzjlhpumjrvcjjpiid.onion) | [http://vid5decwryxwpieu3t7zmp5moafksxtloep4ww7mlycvmec2b22q.b32.i2p *(January 30, 2025)*](http://vid5decwryxwpieu3t7zmp5moafksxtloep4ww7mlycvmec2b22q.b32.i2p)

A blog with topics ranging from philosophical meanderings to deranged
shitposts. A mildly amusing read.

From the words of the web master: "Whenever you are reading one of my articles
keep in mind that I live under a rock and might be completely delusional."

They have Gemini access, which is pretty cool.

Nice car.

I really love the hate emails at the bottom of the page, adds a lot of
character.

### Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal - [https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html *(January 30, 2025)*](https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html)

Cool 2.5D first person shooter. The creator abandoned this "classic" version and
started selling a new version on Steam, but the classic version is still online,
and it's open source!

I'm sure you can expect what kind of content this website has. Just ingore the
Monero address. Or don't, I'm not your mom.

retroactively changing their Terms of Service, etc., to help protect our
consumer rights.

Cooking recipe site that isn't bloated with ads and pointless
JavaScript.

Unfortuantely, it seems that the PRs with new recipes aren't being merged, but
there's still a pretty sizeable amount of recipes on there. Maybe the unaboomer
decided to cut the cord again.

For all you recovering Rust developers out there.

A DNS tool that shows which DNS severs you're using and whether you're using
DNSSEC. I've found it rather useful.

### SuperTuxKart - [https://supertuxkart.net *(November 16, 2024)*](https://supertuxkart.net)

The website for SuperTuxKart, a free as-in freedom racing game.

It's one of my favorite games. If you havent tried it yet, you should! It's
probably available in your package manager.
