### [![](/buttons/landchad.net.gif)](https://landchad.net) LandChad.net - [https://landchad.net](https://landchad.net)

A site that teaches people how to make their own website, and run their own
services, on a server all of their own. Really cool.

### [![](/buttons/based.cooking.gif)](https://based.cooking) Based Cooking - [https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)

Cooking recipe site that isn't bloated with ads and pointless JavaScript.

### [![](/buttons/gorescript.github.io.gif)](https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play) Gorescript classic - [https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play](https://gorescript.github.io/classic/play)

Cool 2.5D first person shooter. The creator abandoned this "classic" version and
started selling a new version on Steam, but the classic version is still online,
and it's FOSS! ([https://github.com/gorescript/gorescript](https://github.com/gorescript/gorescript)).

### The XTerm Window Manager - [https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io](https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io)

A console window manager. Insane, and really cool.
